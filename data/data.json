  "abstract": "Satellite image acquisition scheduling is a problem that is omnipresent in the earth observation field; its goal is to find the optimal subset of images to be taken during a given orbit pass under a set of constraints. This problem, which can be modeled via combinatorial optimization, has been dealt with many times by the artificial intelligence and operations research communities. However, despite its inherent interest, it has been scarcely studied through the quantum computing paradigm. Taking this situation as motivation, we present in this paper two QUBO formulations for the problem, using different approaches to handle the non-trivial constraints. We compare the formulations experimentally over 20 problem instances using three quantum annealers currently available from D-Wave, as well as one of its hybrid solvers. Fourteen of the tested instances have been obtained from the well-known SPOT5 benchmark, while the remaining six have been generated ad-hoc for this study. Our results show that the formulation and the ancilla handling technique is crucial to solve the problem successfully. Finally, we also provide practical guidelines on the size limits of problem instances that can be realistically solved on current quantum computers. ",

  "abstract": "Quantum computers are now on the brink of outperforming their classical counterparts. One way to demonstrate the advantage of quantum computation is through quantum random sampling performed on quantum computing devices. However, existing tools for verifying that a quantum device indeed performed the classically intractable sampling task are either impractical or not scalable to the quantum advantage regime. The verification problem thus remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we experimentally demonstrate efficiently verifiable quantum random sampling in the measurement-based model of quantum computation on a trapped-ion quantum processor. We create random cluster states, which are at the heart of measurement-based computing, up to a size of 4 x 4 qubits. Moreover, by exploiting the structure of these states, we are able to recycle qubits during the computation to sample from entangled cluster states that are larger than the qubit register. We then efficiently estimate the fidelity to verify the prepared states--in single instances and on average--and compare our results to cross-entropy benchmarking. Finally, we study the effect of experimental noise on the certificates. Our results and techniques provide a feasible path toward a verified demonstration of a quantum advantage. ",

These two codes have transversal implementations of all Clifford gates, but require some other scheme for fault-tolerant $T$ gates. Using magic states, Clifford operations, and measurements is one common scheme, but magic state distillation can have a large overhead. Code conversion is one avenue for implementing a universal gate set fault-tolerantly without the use of magic states. Analogously to how the $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code can be fault-tolerantly converted to and from the $[[15,1,3]]$ Reed-Muller code which has a transversal $T$ gate, the $[[23,1,7]]$ Golay code can be converted to a $[[95,1,7]]$ triorthogonal code with a transversal $T$ gate.

However, state-of-the-art error mitigation methods are hard to implement and the limited qubit connectivity in superconducting qubit devices restricts most applications to the hardware's native topology. Here we show a quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) on non-planar random regular graphs with up to 40 nodes enabled by a machine learning-based error mitigation. We use a swap network with careful decision-variable-to-qubit mapping and a feed-forward neural network to demonstrate optimization of a depth-two QAOA on up to 40 qubits. We observe a meaningful parameter optimization for the largest graph which requires running quantum circuits with 958 two-qubit gates. Our work emphasizes the need to mitigate samples, and not only expectation values, in quantum approximate optimization. These results are a step towards executing quantum approximate optimization at a scale that is not classically simulable. Reaching such system sizes is key to properly understanding the true potential of heuristic algorithms like QAOA. ",

  "abstract": "We discuss a new approach to simulate quantum algorithms using classical probabilistic bits and circuits. Each qubit (a two-level quantum system) is initially mapped to a vector in an eight dimensional probability space (equivalently, to a classical random variable with eight probabilistic outcomes). The key idea in this mapping is to store both the amplitude and phase information of the complex coefficients that describe the qubit state in the probabilities. Due to the identical tensor product structure of combining multiple quantum systems as well as multiple probability spaces, $n$ qubits are then mapped to a tensor product of $n$ 8-dimensional probabilistic vectors (i.e., the Hilbert space of dimension $2^n$ is mapped to a probability space of dimension $8^n$). After this initial mapping, we show how to implement the analogs of single-qubit and two-qubit gates in the probability space using correlation-inducing operations on these classical random variables. The key defining feature of both the mapping to the probability space and the transformations in this space (i.e., operations on the random variables) is that they are not linear, but instead affine. Using this architecture, the evolution of the $2^n$ complex coefficients of the quantum system can be tracked in the joint fully-correlated probabilities of the polynomial number of random variables. We then give specific procedures for implementing (1) the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and (2) the Quantum Fourier Transform in the probability space. Identical to the Quantum case, simulating the Quantum Fourier Transform in the probability space requires $O(n)$ probabilistic bits and $O(n^2)$ (i.e., quadratic in the number of quantum bits) operations.

In general, we find that the energy shifts of the molecules and the inter-molecule dipole-dipole interaction obtained in the weak coupling regime are correct only when the counter-rotating interactions are considered. Moreover, under the rotating-wave approximation, the energy shifts of the ground-state molecules and a portion of the inter-molecule interaction are discarded. Notably, in the near-field zone (short inter-molecular distance), the reduction of inter-molecule interaction can reach up to 50 percent. We also conduct a case study on the population dynamics of a pair of identical molecules above a plasmonic surface.

All versions are based on the knowledge of the underlying dynamics. Hence our principle is primarily rooted in the inherent physics and it is not solely an information construct.

However, non-Markovian correlations between the quantum system and environment cause the reliability regression of GST. It is essential to simultaneously describe the gate set and non-Markovian correlations. To this end, we first propose a self-consistent operational method, named instrument set tomography (IST), for non-Markovian GST.

First, we propose a linear inversion IST (LIST) to detect and describe the disharmony of linear relationship of instruments and SE correlations with gauge freedom.

Then, a physically constrained statistical method based on the miximum likelihood estimation for IST (MLE-IST) is proposed with polynomial number of parameters with respect to the Markovian order. It shows significant flexibility that suit for different types of device, e.g. noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, by adjusting the model and constraints.

Second, do a syndrome measurement on a subset of the qubits. Third, perform a fast classical computation to establish which errors have occurred (if any). Fourth, depending on the errors, we apply a correction step. Then the procedure repeats with the next sequence of gates. In order for these four steps to succeed, we need the error rate of the gates to be below a certain threshold. Unfortunately, the error rates of current quantum hardware are still too high. On the other hand, current quantum hardware platforms are designed with these four steps in mind. In this work we make use of this four-step scheme not to carry out fault-tolerant computations, but to enhance short, constant-depth, quantum circuits that perform 1 qubit gates and nearest-neighbor 2 qubit gates. To explore how this can be useful, we study a computational model which we call Local Alternating Quantum Classical Computations (LAQCC). In this model, qubits are placed in a grid allowing nearest neighbor interactions; the quantum circuits are of constant depth with intermediate measurements; a classical controller can perform log-depth computations on these intermediate measurement outcomes to control future quantum operations. This model fits naturally between quantum algorithms in the NISQ era and full fledged fault-tolerant quantum computation.

In hybrid magnonics, the dipolar interaction between magnon and photon usually persists and cannot be switched off. Here, we demonstrate this capability by coupling a superconducting resonator to a layered hybrid perovskite antiferromagnet, which exhibits a magnon band gap due to its intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The pronounced temperature sensitivity of the magnon band gap location allows us to set the photon mode within the gap and to disable magnon-photon hybridization. When the resonator mode falls into the magnon band gap, the resonator damping rate increases due to the nonzero coupling to the detuned magnon mode. This phenomena can be used to quantify the magnon band gap using an analytical model.

Far from being featureless dividing surfaces between neighboring crystals, elucidating features of solid-solid interfaces is challenging and requires theoretical and numerical strategies to describe the physical and mechanical characteristics of these internal interfaces. The first part of this manuscript is concerned with interface-dominated microstructures emerging from polymorphic structural (diffusionless) phase transformations. Under high hydrostatic compression and shock-wave conditions, the pressure-driven phase transitions and the formation of internal diffuse interfaces in iron are captured by a thermodynamically consistent framework for combining nonlinear elastoplasticity and multivariant phase-field approach at large strains. The calculations investigate the crucial role played by the plastic deformation in the morphological and microstructure evolution processes under high hydrostatic compression and shock-wave conditions. The second section is intended to describe such imperfect interfaces at a finer scale, for which the semicoherent interfaces are described by misfit dislocation networks that produce a lattice-invariant deformation which disrupts the uniformity of the lattice correspondence across the interfaces and thereby reduces coherency. For the past ten years, the constant effort has been devoted to combining the closely related Frank-Bilby and O-lattice techniques with the Stroh sextic formalism for the anisotropic elasticity theory of interfacial dislocation patterns. The structures and energetics are quantified and used for rapid computational design of interfaces with tailored misfit dislocation patterns, including the interface sink strength for radiation-induced point defects and semicoherent interfaces.

  "abstract": "Solution-processed few-layers graphene flakes, dispensed to rotating and sliding contacts via liquid dispersions, are gaining increasing attention as friction modifiers to achieve low friction and wear at technologically-relevant interfaces. Vanishing friction states, i.e. superlubricity, have been documented for nearly-ideal nanoscale contacts lubricated by individual graphene flakes; there is however no clear understanding if superlubricity might persist for larger and morphologically-disordered contacts, as those typically obtained by graphene wet transfer from a liquid dispersion. In this study we address the friction performance of solution-processed graphene flakes by means of colloidal probe Atomic Force Microscopy. We use an additive-free aqueous dispersion to coat micrometric silica beads, which are then sled under ambient conditions against prototypical material substrates, namely graphite and the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) MoS2 and WS2. High resolution microscopy proves that the random assembly of the wet-transferred flakes over the silica probes results into an inhomogeneous coating, formed by graphene patches that control contact mechanics through tens-of-nanometers tall protrusions. Atomic-scale friction force spectroscopy reveals that dissipation proceeds via stick-slip instabilities. Load-controlled transitions from dissipative stick-slip to superlubric continuous sliding may occur for the graphene-graphite homojunctions, whereas single- and multiple-slips dissipative dynamics characterizes the graphene-TMD heterojunctions. Systematic numerical simulations demonstrate that the thermally-activated single-asperity Prandtl-Tomlinson model comprehensively describes friction experiments involving different graphene-coated colloidal probes, material substrates and sliding regimes.

  "abstract": "Recently signatures of superconductivity were observed close to 80 K in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ under pressure [1]. This discovery positions La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ as the first bulk nickelate with high-temperature superconductivity, but the lack of zero resistance presents a significant drawback for validating the findings. Here we show that La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ exhibits zero resistance upon applying hydrostatic pressure up to 29.2~GPa using a liquid pressure medium. We find that La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ remains metallic under applied pressures, suggesting the absence of a metal-insulator transition proximate to the superconductivity. Analysis of the normal state $T$-linear resistance suggests an intricate link between this strange metal behaviour and superconductivity, whereby at high pressures both the linear resistance coefficient and superconducting transition are slowly suppressed by pressure, while at intermediate pressures both the superconductivity and strange metal behaviour appear disrupted, possibly due to a nearby structural instability. The association between strange metal behaviour and high-temperature superconductivity is very much in line with diverse classes of unconventional superconductors, including the cuprates and iron-pnictides [2-6]. Understanding the superconductivity of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ evidently requires further revealing the interplay of strange metal behaviour, superconductivity, as well as possible competing electronic or structural phases.

We demonstrate that (i) a positive $t'/t$ significantly amplifies the strength of superconducting orders; (ii) at sufficiently large doping levels, the $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model favors a uniform state with superconducting orders instead of stripe states with charge and spin modulations; and (iii) the enhancement of magnetic frustration, by increasing either the strength of NNN interactions or the charge doping, impairs stripe orders and helps stabilize superconductivity.

They are accordingly termed auxetic, from the Greek auxesis meaning to increase. Experimental studies have demonstrated auxetic materials to have superior material properties, compared with conventional ones. These include synclastic curvature, increased acoustic absorption, increased resilience to material fatigue, and increased resistance to mechanical failure. Until now, the latter observations have remained poorly understood theoretically. With this motivation, the contributions of this work are twofold. First, we elucidate analytically the way in which stress propagates spatially across a material following a localised plastic failure event, finding a significantly reduced stress propagation in auxetic materials compared with conventional ones. In this way, a plastic failure event occurring in one part of a material has a reduced tendency to trigger knock-on plastic events in neighbouring regions. Second, via the numerical simulation of a lattice elastoplastic model, we demonstrate a key consequence of this reduced stress propagation to be an increased resistance to mechanical failure. This is seen not only via an increase in the externally measured yield strain, but also via a decreased tendency for plastic damage to percolate internally across a sample in catastrophic system-spanning clusters.

Our approach shows how the time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble assumption, which is often employed for treating low-dimensional nonequilibrium systems, emerges from systematic diagrammatics.

The latter is based on the large-scale description of the quantum dynamics and it differs from the mean-field prediction even in dimension larger than one.

The study confirms that the enhanced PSA is only present in (and due to) the nematic phase of the elastomer, and the strength of bonding takes over 24 hours to fully reach its maximum value. Such a long saturation time is caused by the slow relaxation of local stress and director orientation in nematic domains after pressing against the surface.

The step function in DOS is a consequence of two-dimensionality of the system in which the motion of nearly-free-particles is confined.

We show that the conjugacy class transitions in the eigenenergy braid results in the changes in the number of bands in a complete point-gap loop. This transition occurs at exceptional points. We numerically demonstrate these concepts using two-dimensional reciprocal and nonreciprocal photonic crystals. ",

We evaluate the ratio of the thermal expectation values of higher spin currents at the critical point to the Gaussian fixed point or the Stefan-Boltzmann result, both for the large $N$ critical $O(N)$ model and the Gross-Neveu model in odd dimensions. This ratio is always less than one and it approaches unity on increasing the spin with the dimension $d$ held fixed.

However, photon-number-resolving detection to unravel the photon statistics is challenging. Here, we propose a novel detection approach, that we call `photon discerning', which uses adaptive photon thresholding for photon statistical estimation without recording exact photon numbers. Our photon discerner is motivated by the field of neural networks where tunable thresholds have proven efficient for isolating optimal decision boundaries in machine learning tasks. The photon discerner maximizes Fisher information per photon by iteratively choosing the optimal threshold in real-time to approach the shot noise limit. Our proposed scheme of adaptive photon thresholding leads to unique remote-sensing applications of quantum DoLP (degree of linear polarization) camera and quantum LiDAR. We investigate optimal thresholds and show that the optimal photon threshold can be counter-intuitive (not equal to 1) even for weak signals (mean photon number much less than 1), due to the photon bunching effect. We also put forth a superconducting nanowire realization of the photon discerner which can be experimentally implemented in the near-term. We show that the adaptivity of our photon discerner enables it to beat realistic photon-number-resolving detectors with limited photon-number resolution.

  "abstract": "A fault-tolerant way to prepare logical code-states of Q1 codes, i.e., quantum polar codes encoding one qubit, has been recently proposed. The fault tolerance therein is guaranteed with the help of an error detection gadget, where if an error is detected during the preparation, one declares a preparation failure and discards entirely the preparation. This makes the preparation probabilistic, whose success rate is referred to as the preparation rate. In this paper, to improve the preparation rate, we consider a factory preparation of Q1 code-states, where one attempts to prepare several copies of Q1 code-states in parallel. With the help of an extra scheduling step, we can avoid discarding the preparation entirely, every time an error is detected, hence, we may achieve an increased preparation rate. We further provide a theoretical method to estimate preparation and logical error rates of the Q1 codes, prepared using factory preparation, which is shown to tightly fit the Monte-Carlo simulation based numerical results. Therefore, our theoretical method is useful for providing estimates for large code-lengths, where Monte-Carlo simulations are practically not feasible. Our numerical results, for a circuit-level depolarizing noise model, indicate that the preparation rate increases significantly, especially for large N. For example, for N = 256, it increases from 0.02% to 27% for a practically interesting physical error rate of p = 10^{-3}. Remarkably, a Q1 code of length N = 256 achieves logical error rates around 10^{-11} and 10^{-15} for the physical error rates of p = 10^{-3} and p = 3 \\times 10^{-4}, respectively, hence, showing the promise of the proposed scheme for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing.

We show that for any density matrix $\\rho$ on $\\mathscr{H}_S$ with small eigenvalues, most wave functions $\\psi$ according to GAP$(\\rho)$ are such that $\\rho_a^\\psi$ is close to $tr_b \\rho$. Our proof is based on a generalization of Levy's lemma (concentration of measure) to GAP$(\\rho)$. We also prove a variant of dynamical typicality for $\\rho_a^{\\psi_t}$ with GAP$(\\rho)$-typical $\\psi_0$ and that the conditional wave function $\\psi_a$ has distribution close to GAP$(tr_b \\rho)$ for typical bases of $\\mathscr{H}_b$ and GAP$(\\rho)$-typical $\\psi$.

  "abstract": "We describe a numerical technique and accompanying open-source Python software package called RydIQule. RydIQule uses a directional graph, relying on adjacency matrices and path-finding to generate a Hamiltonian for multi-level atomic systems. RydIQule then constructs semi-classical equations of motion (Bloch equations) into a tensor which can store an entire simulation consisting of varied system parameters. Using this framework, RydIQule returns solutions significantly faster than typical for interpreted programming languages. RydIQule extends beyond the capabilities of currently-available tools, facilitating rapid development in atomic and Rydberg spectroscopy. To demonstrate its utility, we use RydIQule to simulate a Doppler-broadened Rydberg atomic sensor that simultaneously demodulates five rf tones spanning from 1.7 to 116 GHz. Using RydIQule, this simulation can be solved in several hours on a commercial off-the-shelf desktop computer. ",

  "abstract": "Analog physical neural networks, which hold promise for improved energy efficiency and speed compared to digital electronic neural networks, are nevertheless typically operated in a relatively high-power regime so that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large (>10). What happens if an analog system is instead operated in an ultra-low-power regime, in which the behavior of the system becomes highly stochastic and the noise is no longer a small perturbation on the signal? In this paper, we study this question in the setting of optical neural networks operated in the limit where some layers use only a single photon to cause a neuron activation. Neuron activations in this limit are dominated by quantum noise from the fundamentally probabilistic nature of single-photon detection of weak optical signals. We show that it is possible to train stochastic optical neural networks to perform deterministic image-classification tasks with high accuracy in spite of the extremely high noise (SNR ~ 1) by using a training procedure that directly models the stochastic behavior of photodetection. We experimentally demonstrated MNIST classification with a test accuracy of 98% using an optical neural network with a hidden layer operating in the single-photon regime; the optical energy used to perform the classification corresponds to 0.008 photons per multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation, which is equivalent to 0.003 attojoules of optical energy per MAC. Our experiment used >40x fewer photons per inference than previous state-of-the-art low-optical-energy demonstrations, to achieve the same accuracy of >90%. Our work shows that some extremely stochastic analog systems, including those operating in the limit where quantum noise dominates, can nevertheless be used as layers in neural networks that deterministically perform classification tasks with high accuracy if they are appropriately trained.

Many efforts are addressed to exploit the potential of these materials by tailoring their characteristics. In this work, the optical properties and electronic band structure in three new Dion-Jacobson (DJ) perovskites (PVKs) are engineered by modulating their structural distortion. Two different interlayer cations: 1-6, Hexamethylendiammonium, HE, and 3-(Dimethylamino)-1-propylammonium, DMPA, have been selected to investigate the role of the cation length and the ammonium binding group on the crystalline structure. This study provides new insights into the understanding of the structure-property relationship in DJ perovskites and demonstrates that exciton characteristics can be easily modulated with the judicious design of the organic cations. DJ PVKs developed in this work were also grown as size-controlled single crystal microwires through a microfluidic-assisted synthesis technique and integrated in a nanophotonic device. The DJ PVK microwire acts as a waveguide exhibiting strong light-matter coupling between the crystal optical modes and DJ PVK exciton. Through the investigation of these polariton waveguides, the nature of the double peak emission, which is often observed in these materials and whose nature is largely debated in the literature, is demonstrated originating from the hybrid polariton state.

Recent studies have shown that even homogeneous ABPs exhibit complex behavior due to an interplay between particle softness and motility. However, the heterogeneity in composition of ABPs has not been explored yet. In this paper, we study the structural properties of a binary mixture of ABPs with different particle softness, by varying the relative softness and composition. We found that upon varying the motility parameter, the system underwent a motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) followed by a percolation transition similar to the homogeneous systems; however, there is complex structure formation within the dense phase of the MIPS which depends on the relative softness of the binary system. Furthermore, the presence of a non-linear scaling for different compositions of heterogeneous ABPs suggests that there is a complex relationship between the composition and the structural properties. Our study demonstrates that the composition heterogeneity of ABPs can also lead to complex phase behavior. ",

While this mapping is exact, the transformation itself depends on the labeling of the spins.

In this work, we turn to an extended Jordan-Wigner transformation which remedies this problem and which may also introduce some correlation atop the Hartree-Fock solution of a transformed spin Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that this extended Jordan-Wigner transformation can be thought of as arising from a unitary version of the Lie algebraic similarity transformation (LAST) theory.

The results reveal that the transmission probability of quasiparticles in the $K$ cone is mirror symmetric to that of $K_{\\theta}$ cone about $\\varphi =0$. Furthermore, the study shows that the transmission changes gradually from perfect transmission to perfect reflection in the normal direction by increasing the incident energy and the barrier height, which is different from the case of monolayer and AB-stacked bilayer graphene. It is also found that the double barrier structure remains, only in certain cases, perfectly transparent for normal or near-normal incidence. The chiral nature of the quasiparticles in graphene causes the tunneling to be highly dependent on the direction and also on the double barrier structure. Interestingly, this characteristic provides additional parameter that allows us to tune the electronic properties of the twisted graphene bilayer. Additionally, we found that the transmission exhibits some sharp resonance peaks, the number and amplitude of which depend on the system parameters. Our results provide a better understanding of the chiral tunnelling in twisted graphene bilayer through double barrier structures and can help in designing efficient electronic devices. ",

However, intercalation of Mg underneath monolayer graphene is challenging, requiring multiple intercalation steps. Here, we overcome these challenges and subsequently increase the rate of Mg intercalation by laser patterning (ablating) the graphene to form micron-sized discontinuities. We then use low energy electron diffraction to verify Mg-intercalation and conversion to Mg-QFSBLG, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to determine the Mg intercalation rate for patterned and non-patterned samples. By modeling Mg intercalation with the Verhulst equation, we find that the intercalation rate increase for the patterned sample is 4.5$\\pm$1.7. Since the edge length of the patterned sample is $\\approx$5.2 times that of the non-patterned sample, the model implies that the increased intercalation rate is proportional to the increase in edge length. Moreover, Mg intercalation likely begins at graphene discontinuities in pristine samples (not step edges or flat terraces), where the 2D-like crystal growth of Mg-silicide proceeds. Our laser patterning technique may enable the rapid intercalation of other atomic or molecular species, thereby expanding upon the library of intercalants used to modify the characteristics of graphene, or other 2D materials and heterostructures.

Our micromagnetic simulation results show that the configurations of magnetic domains in the notched nanotrack can be switched between a head-to-head state and a tail-to-tail state in a reversible manner driven by magnetic field pulses, while it is unnecessary to reverse the direction of the magnetic field. Such a unique magnetic domain reorientation dynamics is found to depend on magnetic parameters and nanotrack geometries. The reorientation dynamics of magnetic domains also depends on the strength and length of the applied magnetic field pulse.

  "abstract": "Materials with the mesoscopic scales have provided an excellent platform for quantum-mechanical studies. Among them, the periodic oscillations of the electrical resistivity against the direct and the inverse of the magnetic fields, such as the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the Shubnikov-de Haas effect, manifest the interference of the wavefunction relevant to the electron motion perpendicular to the magnetic field. In contrast, the electron motion along the magnetic field also leads to the magnetic-field periodicity, which is the so-called Sondheimer effect. However, the Sondheimer effect has been understood only in the framework of the semiclassical picture, and thereby its interpretation at the quasiquantum limit was not clear. Here, we show that thin-film graphite exhibits clear sinusoidal oscillations with a period of about 1-3 T over a wide range of the magnetic fields (from around 10 T to 30 T), where conventional quantum oscillations are absent. In addition, the sample with a designed step in the middle for eliminating the stacking disorder effect verifies that the period of the oscillations is inversely proportional to the thickness, which supports the emergence of the Sondheimer oscillations in the quasiquantum limit. These findings suggest that the Sondheimer oscillations can be reinterpreted as inter-Landau-level resonances even at the field range where the semiclassical picture fails. Our results expand the quantum oscillation family, and pave the way for the exploration of the out-of-plane wavefunction motion. ",

The conventional $\\pi$-period planar Hall effect will occur if the mirror reflection symmetry is broken, which buries the anomalous one.

The study of imperfect interfaces affect is of significant importance for the modeling of wave propagation behavior in topological insulators. This paper models a soft Rayleigh beam system with imperfect interfaces, and investigates its topological phase transition process tuned by mechanical loadings. The model reveals that the topological phase transition process can be observed by modifying the distance between imperfect interfaces in the system. When a uniaxial stretch is applied, the topological phase transition points for longitudinal waves decrease within a limited frequency range, while they increase within a larger frequency scope for transverse waves. Enhancing the rigidity of the imperfect interfaces also enables shifting of the topological phase transition point within a broader frequency range for longitudinal waves and a confined range for transverse waves. The transition of topologically protected interface modes in the transmission performance of a twenty-cell system is verified, which include altering frequencies, switching from interface mode to edge mode.

It is critical to derive generic interatomic potential to achieve accurate and effective evaluation of MOFs for H$_2$ adsorption. On this path, as a proof-of-concept, the Al-soc-MOF containing Al-OMS, previously envisaged as a potential candidate for H$_2$ adsorption, was selected and a machine learning potential (MLP) was derived from a dataset initially generated by ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. This MLP was further implemented in MD simulations to explore the binding modes of H$_2$ as well as its temperature dependence distribution in the MOFs pores from 10K to 90K. MLP-Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were further performed to predict the H$_2$ sorption isotherm of Al-soc-MOF at 77K that was further confirmed by gravimetric sorption measurements.

This work delivers the first MLP able to describe accurately the interactions between the challenging H$_2$ guest molecule and MOFs containing OMS.

One crucial class of such novel transport phenomena is the diode effect, which is of great interest for both fundamental physics and modern technologies. In the electrical regime, giant electrical diode effect (the nonreciprocal transport) has been observed in Weyl systems. In the optical regime, novel optical diode effects have been theoretically considered but never probed experimentally. Here, we report the observation of the nonlinear optical diode effect (NODE) in the magnetic Weyl semimetal CeAlSi, where the magnetic state of CeAlSi introduces a pronounced directionality in the nonlinear optical second-harmonic generation (SHG). By physically reversing the beam path, we show that the measured SHG intensity can change by at least a factor of six between forward and backward propagation over a wide bandwidth exceeding 250 meV. Supported by density-functional theory calculations, we establish the linearly dispersive bands emerging from Weyl nodes as the origin of the extreme bandwidth. Intriguingly, the NODE directionality is directly controlled by the direction of magnetization. By utilizing the electronically conductive semimetallic nature of CeAlSi, we demonstrate current-induced magnetization switching and thus electrical control of the NODE in a mesoscopic spintronic device structure with current densities as small as 5 kA/cm$^2$. Our results advance ongoing research to identify novel nonlinear optical/transport phenomena in magnetic topological materials. The NODE also provides a way to measure the phase of nonlinear optical susceptibilities and further opens new pathways for the unidirectional manipulation of light such as electrically controlled optical isolators.

  "abstract": "Voids develop in crystalline materials under energetic particle irradiation, as in nuclear reactors. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of void nucleation and growth is of utmost importance as it leads to dimensional instability of the metallic materials. In the past two decades, researchers have adopted the phase-field approach to study the phenomena of void evolution under irradiation. The approach involves modeling the boundary between the void and matrix with a diffused interface. However, none of the existing models are quantitative in nature. This work introduces a thermodynamically consistent, quantitative diffuse interface model based on KKS formalism to describe the void evolution under irradiation. The model concurrently considers both vacancies and self-interstitials in the description of void evolution. Unique to our model is the presence of two mobility parameters in the equation of motion of the phase-field variable. The two mobility parameters relate the driving force for vacancy and self-interstitial interaction to the interface motion, analogous to dislocation motion through climb and glide processes. The asymptotic matching of the phase-field model with the sharp-interface theory fixes the two mobility parameters in terms of the material parameters in the sharp-interface model. The Landau coefficient, which controls the height of the double-well function in the phase field variable, and the gradient coefficient of the phase field variable are fixed based on the interfacial energy and interface width of the boundary. With all the parameters in the model determined in terms of the material parameters, we thus have a new phase field model for void evolution. Simple test cases will show the void evolution under various defect supersaturation to validate our new phase-field model. ",

We present results for the spin Hall conductivity and correlation lengths for antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations for different values of temperature, spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction. The vertex corrections, which here are analogues of Maki-Thompson contributions, show a strong momentum dependence and give a large contribution in the vicinity of the phase transition at all temperatures. Their inclusion is necessary to observe the quantization of the spin Hall conductivity for the interacting system in the zero temperature limit. At finite temperature, increasing the Hubbard interaction leads to a decrease of the spin Hall conductivity. This decrease can be explained by band-gap renormalization from scattering of electrons on antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. ",

We solve this model numerically and compare its jump-down behaviour with standard asymptotic predictions for a one-dimensional Duffing oscillator with strain stiffening. We show that the axisymmetric, but spatially-varying, problem can be mapped to the Duffing problem with coefficients determined rationally from the model's Partial Differential Equations. However, we also show that jump-down happens earlier than expected (i.e.~at lower frequency, and with a smaller oscillation amplitude). Although this premature jump-down is often interpreted as the signature of a nonlinear damping in experiments, its appearance in numerical simulations with only linear damping suggests instead that indicate that the limitations of asymptotic results may, at least sometimes, be the cause.

In its turn, the knowledge of the full spectrum allows one to study its universality properties such as the appearance of a conformal spectrum in the low-temperature regime. More generally, accessing the full spectrum is a necessary step for deriving thermal form factor series representations of the correlation functions of local operators for the spin chain under consideration.

In this work we implement certain aspects of this programme with the example of the XXZ quantum spin chain in the antiferromagnetic massless regime and in the low-temperature limit. We rigorously establish the existence and characterise the form of the solutions to the non-linear integral equations that are equivalent to the Bethe Ansatz equations for the quantum transfer matrix of this model. This allows us to describe that part of the quantum transfer matrix spectrum that is related to the Bethe Ansatz and that does not collapse to zero in the infinite Trotter number limit. Within the considered part of the spectrum we rigorously identify the dominant Eigenvalue and show that those correlations lengths that diverge in the low-temperature limit are given, to the leading order, by the spectrum of the free Boson $c=1$ conformal field theory.

The developed low-rank three-nucleon interactions are benchmarked in Faddeev calculations of the triton and ab initio calculations of medium-mass nuclei. Exploiting low-rank properties of nuclear interactions will be particularly important for the extension of ab initio studies to heavier and deformed systems, where storage requirements will exceed the computational capacities of the most advanced high-performance-computing facilities.

  "abstract": "The diffusivity of water in aqueous cesium iodide solutions is larger than that in neat liquid water, and vice versa for sodium chloride solutions. Such peculiar ion-specific behavior, called anomalous diffusion, is not reproduced in typical force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations due to inadequate treatment of ion-water interactions. Herein, this hurdle is tackled using machine learned atomic potentials (MLPs) trained on data from density functional theory calculations. MLP-based atomistic MD simulations of aqueous salt solutions reproduce experimentally determined thermodynamic, structural, dynamical, and transport properties, including their varied trends of water diffusivities across salt concentration. This enables an examination of their intermolecular structure to unravel the microscopic underpinnings of the distinction in their transport. While both ions in CsI solutions contribute to faster diffusion of water molecules, the competition between the heavy retardation by Na-ions and slight acceleration by Cl-ions in NaCl solutions reduces their water diffusivity.

The noise spectral density is of the 1/f-type near room temperature but shows signatures of Lorentzian components at elevated temperatures and at higher current levels (f is the frequency). We observed an intriguing non-monotonic dependence of the noise on temperature near T = 380$^\\circ$ K. The Raman spectroscopy of the device structure suggests material changes, which results in reduced noise above this temperature. The normalized noise spectral density in such diodes was determined to be on the order of 10$^{-14}$ cm$^2$/Hz (f = 10 Hz) at 0.1 A/cm$^2$ current density. In terms of the noise level, NiO$_x$/Ga$_2$O$_3$ p-n diodes occupy an intermediate position among devices of various designs implemented with different ultra-wide-band-gap (UWBG) semiconductors.

  "abstract": "The quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) protocol for testing quantum gravity using entanglement witnessing utilizes the creation of spatial quantum superpositions of two neutral, massive matter-wave interferometers kept adjacent to each other, separated by a distance d. The mass and the spatial superposition should be such that the two quantum systems can entangle solely via the quantum nature of gravity. Despite being charge-neutral, there are many electromagnetic backgrounds that can also entangle the systems, such as the dipole-dipole interaction, and the Casimir-Polder interaction. To minimize electromagnetic-induced interactions between the masses it is pertinent to isolate the two superpositions by a conducting plate. However, the conducting plate will also exert forces on the masses and hence the trajectories of the two superpositions would be affected. To minimize this effect, we propose to trap the two interferometers such that the trapping potential dominates over the attraction between the conducting plate and the matter-wave interferometers. The superpositions can still be created via the Stern-Gerlach effect in the direction parallel to the plate, where the trapping potential is negligible. The combination of trapping and shielding provides a better parameter space for the parallel configuration of the experiment, where the requirement on the size of the spatial superposition, to witness the entanglement between the two masses purely due to their quantum nature of gravity, decreases by at least two orders of magnitude as compared to the original protocol paper.

Given the high number of 2-local operators necessary for realizing a feature mapping hard to simulate classically, a high qubit connectivity is needed, which is not currently possible on superconducting devices. For this reason, neutral atom quantum computers can be used, since they allow to arrange the atoms with more freedom. Examples of neutral-atom-based QKE can be found in the literature, but they are focused on graph learning and use the analogue approach. In this paper, a general method based on the gate model is presented. After deriving 1-qubit and 2-qubit gates starting from laser pulses, a parameterized sequence for feature mapping on 3 qubits is realized. This sequence is then used to empirically compute the kernel matrix starting from a dataset, which is finally used to train the SVM. It is also shown that this process can be generalized up to N qubits taking advantage of the more flexible arrangement of atoms that this technology allows. The accuracy is shown to be high despite the small dataset and the low separation. This is the first paper that not only proposes an algorithm for explicitly deriving a universal set of gates but also presents a method of estimating quantum kernels on neutral atom devices for general problems using the gate model.

These are initiated by devising two types of active supersymmetrization transformations and momentum operator maps, which work to transform the same eigenequation of HLDO in its two trivial asymmetric factorizations into two distinct supersymmetrically factorized Schr\\\"odinger equations. The rest iteration flows are completely controlled by repeatedly performing intertwining action and incorporating some generalized commutator relations to renormalize the superpartner equation of the eigenequation of present level into that of next level. These algorithms therefore provide a simple SUSYQM answer to the question regarding why there exist simultaneously a series of principal as well as associated eigenfunctions for the same HLDO, which boils down to two basic facts: two distinct types of quantum momentum kinetic energy operators and superpotentials are rooted in this operator; each initial superpotential can proliferate into a hierarchy of descendant ones in a shape-invariant fashion. The two active supersymmetrizations establish the isomorphisms between the nonstandard and standard coordinate representations of the SUSYQM algorithm either for principal HLDO or for its associated one, so these algorithms can be constructed in either coordinate representation with equal efficiency. Due to their relatively high efficiency, algebraic elementariness and logical independence, the iterative SUSYQM algorithms developed in this paper could become the hopefuls for supplanting some traditional methods for solving the eigenvalue problems of principal HLDOs and their associated cousins.

Our results show that, in both the Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics, the charging characteristics, including the charging energy, efficiency and ergotropy, regularly increase with increasing the speed of charger and battery qubits.

Focusing on supervised learning, we present a mathematical framework for evaluating the resolvable expressive capacity (REC) of general physical systems under finite sampling noise, and provide a methodology for extracting its extrema, the eigentasks. Eigentasks are a native set of functions that a given physical system can approximate with minimal error. We show that the REC of a quantum system is limited by the fundamental theory of quantum measurement, and obtain a tight upper bound for the REC of any finitely-sampled physical system. We then provide empirical evidence that extracting low-noise eigentasks can lead to improved performance for machine learning tasks such as classification, displaying robustness to overfitting. We present analyses suggesting that correlations in the measured quantum system enhance learning capacity by reducing noise in eigentasks. The applicability of these results in practice is demonstrated with experiments on superconducting quantum processors.

As a result, the Moyal equation becomes the classical Liouville equation for the distribution function.

We consider the specific example of qubits encoded in the clock states states of cesium. An auxiliary hyperfine state is optically dressed so that it acquires partial Rydberg character. It thus acts as a proxy Rydberg state, with a nonlinear light-shift that plays the role of blockade strength. A microwave-frequency field coupling a qubit state to this dressed auxiliary state can be modulated to implement entangling gates. Logic gate protocols designed for the optical regime can be imported to this microwave regime, for which experimental control methods are more robust.

In the first part of this work we address the raw swapping protocol (i. e. without local filtering) and our findings are as follows. First, using the Bloch representation of quantum states, we show that all of the above properties of a general quantum state can fully be preserved whenever the state is swapped together with arbitrary combinations of Bell states and Bell measurements. This generalises a result shown for the concurrence of states in the X-form. Second, we derive an explicit formula for the quantum obesity of the final post-swapping state in terms of the obesity of general input states and measurements, and therefore establishing the limit at which obesity can be swapped. In the second part we address the effect of local filtering operations on the swapping of quantum correlations. Specifically, we explore whether experimentalists should implement local filters before or after the swapping protocol takes place, so in order to maximize the final amount of correlations. In this regard, we first show that these two scenarios are equivalent for the family of Bell-diagonal states, for all of the above-mentioned quantum correlations. We then prove that applying local filters first can be more efficient when considering the strictly larger family of almost Bell-diagonal states, with the quantum obesity as the test property. Finally, we provide numerical evidence for this latter phenomenon (local filtering first is more efficient) holding true for general two-qubit states in the X-form, for all of the above-mentioned quantum correlations.

  "abstract": "Recent work has identified cosmic ray events as an error source limiting the lifetime of quantum data. These errors are correlated and affect a large number of qubits, leading to the loss of data across a quantum chip. Previous works attempting to address the problem in hardware or by building distributed systems still have limitations. We approach the problem from a different perspective, developing a new hybrid hardware-software-based strategy based on the 2-D surface code, assuming the parallel development of a hardware strategy that limits the phonon propagation radius. We propose to flee the area: move the logical qubits far enough away from the strike's epicenter to maintain our logical information. Specifically, we: (1) establish the minimum hardware requirements needed for our approach; (2) propose a mapping for moving logical qubits; and (3) evaluate the possible choice of the code distance. Our analysis considers two possible cosmic ray events: those far from both ``holes'' in the surface code and those near or overlapping a hole. We show that the probability that the logical qubit will be destroyed can be reduced from 100% to the range 4% to 15% depending on the time required to move the logical qubit. ",

  "abstract": "Controlled quantum teleportation (CQT) can be considered as a variant of quantum teleportation in which three parties are involved where one party acts as the controller. The usability of the CQT scheme depends on two types of fidelities viz. conditioned fidelity and non-conditioned fidelity. The difference between these fidelities may be termed as power of the controller and it plays a vital role in the CQT scheme. Thus, our aim is to estimate the power of the controller in such a way so that its estimated value can be obtained in an experiment. To achieve our goal, we have constructed a witness operator and have shown that its expected value may be used in the estimation of the lower bound of the power of the controller. Furthermore, we have shown that it is possible to make the standard W state useful in the CQT scheme if one of its qubits either passes through the amplitude damping channel or the phase damping channel. We have also shown that the phase damping channel performs better than the amplitude damping channel in the sense of generating more power of the controller in the CQT scheme. ",

  "abstract": "Photon counting simulations are crucial for designing and optimizing quantum photonic devices. The naive way to simulate time-integrated measurements of light requires integrating multi-variable correlations. This causes simulation times to increase exponentially with the correlation order, or number of detected photons. In this work, I present a method to simulate time-integrated quantities from the time dynamics of quantum emitters without multi-variable integration. The approach uses an effective master equation defined by a zero-photon generator -- a generator of time dynamics conditioned on the absence of detected light. The zero-photon conditional dynamics depends on an efficiency parameter for each detector. These parameters can take complex values to define a set of virtual detector configurations that can be exploited to reconstruct integrated quantities using an inverse Z-transform such as a discrete Fourier transform. The method can accelerate the simulation of single-photon sources and entangled photonic resource states for measurement-based quantum computing while accounting for physical imperfections of realistic devices. It also provides a general framework to simulate interactions between stationary qubits mediated by measurements of flying qubits, which has applications to model noise for distributed quantum computing and quantum communication protocols.

We approximate this quantum phase space representation of the canonical density operator for general temperatures in terms of classical trajectories, which are obtained through a Wick rotation of the semiclassical approximation for the Weyl propagator. A numerical scheme which allows us to apply the approximation for a broad class of systems is also developed. The approximation is assessed by testing it against systems with one and two degrees of freedom, which shows that, for a considerable range of parameters, the thermodynamic averages are well reproduced.

The resulting shot-noise clearance of $(46.0\\pm1.1)~\\mathrm{dB}$ is the highest reported clearance for a balanced optical homodyne detector, demonstrating their potential for measuring highly squeezed states in the continuous-wave regime.

However, applying such a formalism to qubit systems is limited due to the negativity in the Wigner function induced by Clifford operations. In this work, we introduce a novel classical simulation method for non-adaptive Clifford circuits based on the framed Wigner function, an extended form of the qubit Wigner function characterized by a binary-valued frame function. Our approach allows for updating phase space points under Clifford circuits without inducing negativity in the Wigner function by switching to a suitable frame when applying each Clifford gate. By leveraging this technique, we establish a sufficient condition for efficient classical simulation of Clifford circuits even with non-stabilizer inputs, where direct application of the Gottesmann-Knill tableau method is not feasible. We further develop a graph-theoretical approach to identify classically simulatable marginal outcomes of Clifford circuits and explore the number of simulatable qubits of log-depth circuits. We also present the Born probability estimation scheme using the framed Wigner function and discuss its precision. Our approach opens new avenues for quasi-probability simulation of quantum circuits, thereby expanding the boundary of classically simulatable circuits. ",

We find that maximally entangled Bell states alone do not help extract useful work from the reservoir unless some extra populations in the excited states or ground states are taken into account. Furthermore, high efficiency and work output are shown for the non-maximally entangled superradiant state, while negligible for the subradiant state due to lack of emitted photons inside the cavity.

Here we show that energy can be extracted efficiently from CPTP-local passive states employing non-completely positive trace-preserving (NCPTP) but still physically realizable maps on the same part of the shared battery on which operation of CPTP maps were useless. Thus, we realize that energy extraction from CPTP-local passive states using an unknown map can be utilized as a witness for detection of the NCPTP nature of that map. Further, we show that the maximum extractable energy using local CPTP maps on one party can be strictly less than that using local NCPTP maps on the same party.

The auxiliary is then traced out of the system, and the relevant state of the battery is the final state. We consider the product of the energy difference between the initial and final states with the probability of getting the measurement outcome that reduces to that final state. We define the maximum value of this quantity as the stochastically extractable energy. Restricting ourselves to a particular uncountable set of states, we find that stochastically extractable energy is always higher than the maximum energy that can be extracted from the battery by applying unitary operations, even if the initial auxiliary-battery state is a product. We show that a non-zero entanglement present initially between the battery and the auxiliary can induce an even higher amount of stochastic energy extraction than that for product initial states. Further, the set of states for which stochastically extractable energy is zero is determined for all product initial states and found to only consist of a single state, viz., the ground state. ",

We experimentally measure flow structures and energy spectra of bacterial turbulence between two large parallel plates spaced by different heights $H$. The turbulence exhibits three regimes as H increases, resulting from the competition of bacterial length, vortex size and H. This is marked by two critical heights ($H_0$ and $H_1$) and a $H^{0.5}$ scaling law of vortex size in the large-$H$ limit. Meanwhile, the spectra display distinct universal scaling laws in quasi-two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) regimes, independent of bacterial activity, length and $H$, whereas scaling exponents exhibit transitions in the crossover.

We hypothesize that this variability is due to the much higher sensitivity of the OBD blind spot to changes in longitudinal and electrostatic forces. We found that for OBD detection the combination of unknown out of plane and in-plane piezoresponse, long-range electrostatic interactions and uncontrolled and unknown in-plane tip-sample mechanical forces leads to difficulties in both identifying and staying at the OBD blind spot as well as systematic, position-dependent errors. In contrast, IDS measurements with the laser spot above the tip are relatively insensitive to these complications, enabling precise measurements of the vertical piezoresponse. ",

Among them, kagome-structured metals such as CoSn have been recognized as promising candidates due to the proximity between the flat bands and the Fermi level. A key next step will be to realize epitaxial kagome thin films with flat bands to enable tuning of the flat bands across the Fermi level via electrostatic gating or strain. Here we report the band structures of epitaxial CoSn thin films grown directly on insulating substrates. Flat bands are observed using synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The band structure is consistent with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and the transport properties are quantitatively explained by the band structure and semiclassical transport theory.

However, they are expensive and lack responsiveness to external stimuli, limiting their use in sensing applications. In contrast, low-cost nanoscale mesoporous materials, known for their high surface-to-volume ratio, have shown promise in various applications. We recently demonstrated that mesoporous silicon dioxide (SiO2) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin layers can support coherent acoustic modes in the 5 to 100 GHz range. In this study, we propose a new method for designing tunable acoustic resonators using mesoporous thin films on acoustic distributed Bragg reflectors. By infiltrating the pores with different chemicals, the material's properties could be altered and achieve tunability in the acoustic resonances. We present four device designs and use simulations to predict resonators with Q-factors up to 1000. We also observe that the resonant frequency and intensity show a linear response to relative humidity, with a tunability of up to 60 %.

Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in electrode performance when murexide is used as a capping or dispersing agent compared to the case with no additives. When murexide is used as a capping agent, we report a capacitance of 4.2 F cm$^{-2}$ from cyclic voltammetry analysis with good capacitance retention at high scan rate. From impedance measurements, we reveal a substantial decrease in the real part of impedance for samples prepared with murexide, indicating easier charge transfer at more negative electrode potentials, and reinforcing the role of murexide as a capping agent and charge transfer mediator. Density functional theory is used to investigate interactions between the murexide adsorbate and the Fe$_3$O$_4$ (001) surface, with a specific emphasis on adsorption strength, charge transfer, and electronic properties. This theoretical investigation uncovers a strong adsorption enthalpy of -4.5 eV, and allows us to identify the nature of chemical bonds between murexide and the surface, with significant charge transfer taking place between the Fe$_3$O$_4$ surface and murexide adsorbate. The transfer of electrons from the Fe$_3$O$_4$ surface to murexide is recognized as a vital component of the adsorption process.

Can a LL-like state, in which electronic excitations are fractionalized modes, emerge in a 2D system as a stable zero-temperature phase? This long-standing question, first brought up by Anderson decades ago, is crucial in the study of non-Fermi liquids but remains unsettled. A recent experiment identified a moir\\'e superlattice of twisted bilayer tungsten ditelluride (tWTe_2) with a small interlayer twist angle as a 2D host of the LL physics at temperatures of a few kelvins. Here we report experimental evidence for a 2D anisotropic LL state in a substantially reduced temperature regime, down to at least 50 mK, spontaneously formed in a tWTe_2 system with a twist angle of ~ 3 degree. While the system is metallic-like and nearly isotropic above 2 K, a dramatically enhanced electronic anisotropy develops in the millikelvin regime, featuring distinct transport behaviors along two orthogonal in-plane directions. In the strongly anisotropic phase, we observe transport characteristics of a 2D LL phase, i.e., the universal power law scaling behaviors in across-wire conductance and a zero-bias dip in the differential resistance along the wire direction. Our results represent a step forward in the search for stable LL physics beyond 1D and related unconventional quantum matter. ",

  "abstract": "Frustrated magnets typically possess a large space of classical ground states. If this degeneracy is not protected by symmetry, thermal fluctuations may 'select' certain states via order-by-disorder. We examine the role of geometry in this mechanism in the context of classical magnets. We consider two model magnetic clusters, each with four spins coupled by XY interactions. In the first, the classical ground states form a smooth space. In the second, they form a self-intersecting non-manifold space. State selection is very different in these two cases. We first consider the microcanonical ensemble picture, where fluctuations conserve energy. Phase space arguments suggest that the first model samples the set of classical ground states with energy-independent probabilities. The second shows a dramatic energy-dependence with relative probability increasing as $\\epsilon^{-1/2}$, where $\\epsilon$ is the energy of the system. We simulate low-energy dynamics in both models, confirming the expected behaviour. We next consider the canonical ensemble, where the first model produces temperature-independent probabilities. In the second, relative probability rises sharply as $T^{-1/2}$, where $T$ is the temperature. Our results bring out a classical analogue of order-by-singularity, a mechanism that has been recently proposed in the context of quantum spin clusters. State selection is qualitatively different in systems with self-intersecting ground state spaces. It grows at low energies and becomes perfect as $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$ (microcanonical ensemble) or $T\\rightarrow 0$ (canonical ensemble).

  "abstract": "The reciprocal interconversion between spin polarization and charge current (CSC) is the focus of intensive theoretical and experimental investigation in spintronics research. Its physical origin stems from the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by the breaking of the structure inversion symmetry. The steady-state interconversion efficiency is the result of the non-trivial spin textures of the electric-field distorted Fermi surface. Its full understanding and evaluation requires the consideration of disorder-induced relaxation effects in the presence of spin-orbit induced band splitting. In this paper the additional effect of the orbital degree of freedom is analyzed in a two-subband quantum well with both conventional and unconventional Rashba SOC in the presence of disorder impurity scattering. The latter is treated at the level of the Born approximation in the Green's function self-energy and with the inclusion of vertex corrections in the linear response functions for the charge current and the spin polarization. By explicitly considering the symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian the matrix structure of the correlation functions is shown to decompose in independent blocks of symmetry-related physical observables. We find that the inclusion of vertex corrections is important for the correct estimate of the CSC efficiency, which also depends on the position of the Fermi level. We also find that the relative sign of the Rashba SOC in the two subbands plays a key role in determining the behavior of the CSC. Finally, we point out how the two-subband model compares with the standard single-band two-dimensional electron gas. ",

In the simulations, two cases are considered: freely diffusing tracer (passive microrheology) and tracer pulled with a constant force (active microrheology). Both cases are connected by linear response theory for all tracer sizes. It links both the stationary and transient regimes of the pulled tracer (for low forces) with the equilibrium correlation functions; the velocity of the pulled tracer and its displacement are obtained from the velocity auto-correlation function and the mean squared displacement, respectively. The MCT calculations give insight into the physical mechanisms: At short times, the tracer rattles in its cage of neighbours, with the frequency increasing linearly with the tracer radius asymptotically. The long-time tracer diffusion coefficient from passive microrheology, which agrees with the inverse friction coefficient from the active case, arises from the transport of transverse momentum around the tracer. It can be described with the Brinkman equation for the transverse flow field obtained in extension of MCT, but cannot be recovered from the MCT kernel coupling to densities only. The dynamics of the bath particles is also studied; for the unforced tracer the dynamics is unaffected, irrespective of the distance from the tracer. When the tracer is pulled, the velocity field in the bath decays with the distance from the tracer as 1/r3, as predicted by the Brinkman model, but different from the case of a Newtonian fluid. ",

Here, we investigate the electronic structures of LK-99 and its parent compound using first-principles calculations, aiming to elucidate the doping effects of Cu. Our results reveal that the parent compound Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O is an insulator, while Cu doping induces an insulator-metal transition and thus volume contraction. The band structures of LK-99 around the Fermi level are featured by a half-filled flat band and a fully-occupied flat band. These two flat bands arise from both the $2p$ orbitals of $1/4$-occupied O atoms and the hybridization of the $3d$ orbitals of Cu with the $2p$ orbitals of its nearest-neighboring O atoms. Interestingly, we observe four van Hove singularities on these two flat bands, indicating electronic instability towards structural distortions at low temperatures. Furthermore, we show that the band energies of the van Hove singularities can be tuned by including electronic correlation effects or doping with different elements. We find that among the considered doping elements (Ni, Cu, Zn, Ag, and Au), both Ni and Zn doping result in the gap opening, whereas Au exhibits doping effects more similar to Cu than Ag.

Correspondingly, the exergy difference between two states is the maximum work output when the system changes from one state to the other, assuming that during the processes, the system exchanges heat reversibly with the environment. If the process involves irreversibility, the Guoy-Stodola theorem states that the exergy destruction equals the entropy generated during the process multiplied by To. The exergy concept and the Gouy-Stodola theorem are widely used to optimize processes or systems, even when they are not directly connected to the environment. In the past, questions have been raised on if To is the proper temperature to use in calculating the exergy destruction. Here, we start from the first and the second laws of thermodynamics to unambiguously show that the useful energy loss (UEL) of a system or process should equal to the entropy generation multiplied by an equivalent temperature associated with the entropy rejected out of the entire system. For many engineering systems and processes, this entropy rejection temperature can be easily calculated as the ratio of the changes of the enthalpy and entropy of the fluid stream carrying the entropy out, which we call the state-change temperature. The UEL is unambiguous and independent of the environmental dead state, and it should be used for system optimization rather than the exergy destruction. ",

Experiments have shown temperature discontinuities at the interface during evaporation and condensation but the experimentally reported interface temperature jump varies by two orders of magnitude. Even the direction of such temperature jump is still being debated. Using kinetic-theory based expressions for the interfacial mass flux and heat flux, we solve coupled problem between the liquid and the vapor phase during evaporation and condensation. Our model shows that when evaporation or condensation happens, an intrinsic temperature difference develops across the interface, due to the mismatch of the enthalpy carried by vapor at the interface and the bulk region. The vapor temperature near the interface cools below the saturation temperature on the liquid surface during evaporation and heats up above the latter during condensation. However, many existing experiments have shown an opposite trend to this prediction. We explain this difference as arising from the reverse heat conduction in the vapor phase. Our model results compare favorably with experiments on both evaporation and condensation. We show that when the liquid layer is very thin, most of the applied temperature difference between the solid wall and the vapor phase happens at the liquid-vapor interface, leading to saturation of the evaporation and the condensation rates and the corresponding heat transfer rate. This result contradicts current belief that the evaporation and condensation rates are inversely proportional to the liquid film thickness. ",

Present investigation reports ECE in lead-free (Na0.8K0.2)0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (NKBT) ceramic by direct and indirect methods, which confirm the multifunctional nature of NKBT and its usefulness for applications in refrigeration and energy storage. A direct method of EC measurement in NKBT ceramic exhibits significant adiabatic temperature change ({\\Delta}T) ~ 1.10 K and electrocaloric strength ({\\xi}) ~ 0.55 Kmm/kV near the ferroelectric to non-ergodic phase transition at an external applied field of 20 kV/cm. A highest recoverable energy (Wrec) ~ 0.78 J/cm3 and electrical storage efficiency ({\\eta}) ~ 86% are achieved at 423 K and an applied field of 20 kV/cm. This behavior is ascribed to the delicate balance between the field induced order-disordered transition and the thermal energy needed to disrupt field induced co-operative interaction. ",

  "abstract": "We study spin dynamics of ordered phases of Cs2CoBr4 in a magnetic field using electron spin resonance (ESR) technique and theoretical analysis. This material hosts weakly interacting distorted-triangular-lattice planes of spin-3/2 Co(2+) ions which can be viewed as spin chains coupled by frustrating interactions. Strong single-ion anisotropy allows to describe the low-energy spin dynamics of this system by an effective strongly anisotropic pseudospin-1/2 model. Our ESR data show up to seven branches of magnetic resonance in four magnetic phases arising due to subtle interplay of frustration, low dimensionality and strong anisotropy. In particular, in the low-field collinear stripe phase, the field evolution of modes lying below 200 GHz is described reasonably good by spectra of spin-1 and spin-0 quasiparticles which we obtain using the bond-operator technique. These well-defined excitations can be treated as conventional magnons and bound states of two magnons, respectively. In contrast, numerous excitations lying above 200 GHz are not captured by our theory due to pronounced one-dimensional correlations inside spin chains which govern the spin dynamics at high enough energies. As it was shown before, these modes can be most naturally interpreted as bound states of domain walls in individual chains and their sequence resembles the so-called \"Zeeman ladder\" in anisotropic Ising-like spin chains. Thus, Cs2CoBr4 is a system showing spin-dynamics in ordered state characteristic of both two-dimensional and one-dimensional magnets. ",

  "abstract": "Trench defects in multi-quantum wells (MQWs) have been considered as flawed structures that severely degrade the internal quantum efficiency of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in the past. In this research, trench defects are innovatively modulated into the structure to enhance the efficiency of red InGaN LEDs. Specifically, dual-color MQWs structures are grown with green MQWs at the bottom and red MQWs at the top. When high-density trench defects are introduced into the green MQWs, the upper red MQWs exhibit a significant wavelength redshift of 68 nm and approximately 6-fold luminescence enhancement compared to those without trench defects. The wavelength redshift is attributed to the increased indium incorporation due to the strain relaxation effect of trench defects. Moreover, the luminescence enhancement originates from the strong emission of the red MQWs inside trench defects. The mechanisms behind the superior luminescent properties of red MQWs within trench defects are explored in detail. Red InGaN LEDs with an internal quantum efficiency of 16.4% are achieved by modulating the trench defects. The method of achieving InGaN-based red emission by introducing trench defects is simple and reproducible, requiring no additional substrate designs. This research provides a novel pathway toward achieving high-efficiency red InGaN LEDs. ",

  "abstract": "Classical first passage under resetting is a paradigm in the search process. Despite its multitude applications across interdisciplinary sciences, experimental realizations of such resetting processes posit practical challenges in calibrating these zero time irreversible transitions. We consider a strategy in which resetting is performed using a finite time return control protocol in lieu of instantaneous returns. These controls could also be accompanied with random fluctuations or errors allowing target detection even during the return phase. To better understand the phenomena, we develop a unified renewal approach that can encapsulate arbitrary search processes in a fairly general topography containing targets, various resetting times and return mechanisms in arbitrary dimensions. While such time-costly protocols would apparently seem to impede the overall search efficiency, we show that by leveraging the stochasticity in returns one can expedite the completion gained even under instantaneous resetting. The formalism is then explored to reveal a universal criterion distilling the benefits of this strategy. We demonstrate how this general principle can be utilized to improve overall performance of a one-dimensional diffusive search process. We believe that such strategies designed with inherent randomness can be made optimal with precise controllability in complex search processes. ",

Accurate theoretical approaches to simulate spin lifetimes ($\\tau_s$), determining how fast the spin polarization and phase information will be lost, are important to the understandings of underlying mechanism of these spin processes, and invaluable to search for promising candidates of spintronic materials. Recently, we develop a first-principles real-time density-matrix (FPDM) approach to simulate spin dynamics for general solid-state systems.

The finite-momentum pairing manifests itself, in particular, as a nonmonotonic dependence of the critical temperature of the bilayer on the thickness of the F layer. Here we predict that despite the absence of the macroscopic exchange field the critical temperature of the antiferromagnet/superconductor (AF/S) bilayers also exhibit nonmonotonic (oscillating) dependence on the AF layer thickness. It is a manifestation of the proximity-induced Neel-type triplet correlations, which acquire finite total pair momentum and oscillate in the AF layer due to the Umklapp electron scattering processes at the AF/S interface.

  "abstract": "Superconductivity is realized by opening a gap in the superconducting state. The gap symmetry is crucial in understanding the underlying superconductivity mechanism. The magnitude and the phase are essential in fully characterizing the superconducting gap. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has played a key role in determining the gap symmetry in unconventional superconductors. However, it has been considered so far that ARPES can only measure the magnitude of the superconducting gap but not its phase; the phase has to be detected by other phase-sensitive techniques. Here we propose a new method to directly detect the superconducting gap sign by using ARPES. This method is successfully validated in a cuprate superconductor with a well-known $d$-wave gap symmetry. When two bands are nearby in momentum space and have a strong interband interaction, the resulted electronic structures in the superconducting state are sensitive to the relative gap sign between the two bands which can be captured by ARPES measurements. Our present work provides a new way to detect the gap sign and can be applied to various superconductors, particularly those with multiple orbitals like the iron-based superconductors. It also makes ARPES more powerful to determine both the gap magnitude and the phase that are significant in understanding the superconductivity mechanism of unconventional superconductors. ",

Here we investigate the magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday effects in bilayer antiferromagnetic insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$.

Under perpendicular electric field, antiferromagnetic topological insulators (AFMTI) show sharp peaks at the interband transition threshold, whereas trivial insulators show small adjacent positive and negative peaks. Gate voltage and Fermi energy can be tuned to reveal the differences between AFMTI and trivial insulators. We find that AFMTI with large antiferromagnetic order can be proposed as a pure magneto-optical rotator due to sizable Kerr (Faraday) angles and vanishing ellipticity. Under external magnetic moment, AFMTI and trivial insulators are significantly different in the magnitude of Kerr and Faraday angles and ellipticity. For the qualitative behaviors, AFMTI shows distinct features of Kerr and Faraday angles when the spin configurations of the system change.

In systems displaying this behavior, the mean squared displacement of the diffusing particles grows linearly in time, like in a normal diffusion, but the distribution of displacements is non-Gaussian. In situations when the convergence to Gaussian still takes place at longer times, the probability density of the displacements may show a persisting peak around the distribution's mode, and the pathway of convergence to the Gaussian is unusual. One of the theoretical models showing such a behavior corresponds to a disordered system with local diffusion coefficients slowly varying in space. While the standard pathway to Gaussian, as proposed by the Central Limit Theorem, would assume that the peak, under the corresponding rescaling, smoothens and lowers in course of the time; in the model discussed, the peak, under rescaling, narrows and stays sharp. In the present work, we discuss the nature of this peak. On a coarse-grained level, the motion of the particles in the diffusivity landscape is described by continuous time random walks with correlations between waiting times and positions. The peak is due to strong spatiotemporal correlations along the trajectories of diffusing particles. Destroying these correlations while keeping the temporal structure of the process intact leads to the decay of the peak. We also note that the correlated CTRW model reproducing serial correlations between the waiting times along the trajectory fails to quantitatively reproduce the shape of the peak even for the decorrelated motion, while being quite accurate in the wings of the PDF. This shows the importance of high-order temporal correlations for the peak's formation. ",

We further find that the melting rates are thermally activated, with activation energies of Ea = 18 meV and 13 meV for the correlated states with one and two holes (v = -1 and -2) per moir\\'e unit cell, respectively, suggesting significant electron-phonon coupling. The overall temperature dependences in the exciton oscillator strength, a proxy to the order parameter for the correlated states, gives estimates of Tc in agreement with the extracted Ea. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the moir\\'e scale confirm polaron formation in the v = -1 Mott state and predict a hole polaron binding energy of 16 meV, in agreement with experiment. These findings suggest a close interplay of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the formation of polaronic Mott insulators at TMD moir\\'e interfaces. ",

  "abstract": "Matrix factorization is an inference problem that has acquired importance due to its vast range of applications that go from dictionary learning to recommendation systems and machine learning with deep networks. The study of its fundamental statistical limits represents a true challenge, and despite a decade-long history of efforts in the community, there is still no closed formula able to describe its optimal performances in the case where the rank of the matrix scales linearly with its size. In the present paper, we study this extensive rank problem, extending the alternative 'decimation' procedure that we recently introduced, and carry out a thorough study of its performance. Decimation aims at recovering one column/line of the factors at a time, by mapping the problem into a sequence of neural network models of associative memory at a tunable temperature. Though being sub-optimal, decimation has the advantage of being theoretically analyzable. We extend its scope and analysis to two families of matrices. For a large class of compactly supported priors, we show that the replica symmetric free entropy of the neural network models takes a universal form in the low temperature limit. For sparse Ising prior, we show that the storage capacity of the neural network models diverges as sparsity in the patterns increases, and we introduce a simple algorithm based on a ground state search that implements decimation and performs matrix factorization, with no need of an informative initialization.

While the chemically stable GNRs with armchair edges (AGNRs) are semiconductors with width-tunable band gap, GNRs with zigzag edges (ZGNRs) host spin-polarized edge states, which renders them interesting for applications in spintronic and quantum technologies. However, these states significantly increase their reactivity. For GNRs fabricated via on-surface synthesis under ultrahigh vacuum conditions on metal substrates, the expected reactivity of zigzag edges is a serious concern in view of substrate transfer and device integration under ambient conditions, but corresponding investigations are scarce. Using 10-bromo-9,9':10',9''-teranthracene as a precursor, we have thus synthesized hexanthene (HA) and teranthene (TA) as model compounds for ultrashort GNRs with mixed armchair and zigzag edges, characterized their chemical and electronic structure by means of scanning probe methods, and studied their chemical reactivity upon air exposure by Raman spectroscopy. We present a detailed identification of molecular orbitals and vibrational modes, assign their origin to armchair or zigzag edges, and discuss the chemical reactivity of these edges based on characteristic Raman spectral features.

However, there is still limited understanding of their basic elastic properties and how they vary with composition and temperature, which is relevant for synthesis and device operation. To address this, we performed temperature- and pressure-dependent synchrotron-based powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). In contrast to previous pressure-dependent XRD studies, our relatively low pressures (ambient to 0.06 GPa) enabled us to investigate the elastic properties of halide perovskites and elpasolites in their ambient crystal structure. We find that halide perovskites and elpasolites show common trends in the bulk modulus and thermal expansivity. Both materials become softer as the halide ionic radius increases from Cl to Br to I, exhibiting higher compressibility and larger thermal expansivity. The mixed-halide compositions show intermediate properties to the pure compounds. Contrary, cations show a minor effect on the elastic properties. Finally, we observe that thermal phase transitions in e.g., MAPbI3 and CsPbCl3 lead to a softening of the lattice, together with negative expansivity for certain crystal axes, already tens of degrees away from the transition temperature. Hence, the range in which the phase transition affects thermal and elastic properties is substantially broader than previously thought. These findings highlight the importance of considering the temperature-dependent elastic properties of these materials, since stress induced during manufacturing or temperature sweeps can significantly impact the stability and performance of the corresponding devices.

Here we approach the computational challenge to model bacterial biofilms for predictive mechanics in silico under variable stress conditions. Up-to-date models are not entirely satisfactory due to the plethora of parameters required to make them functioning under the effects of stress. As guided by the structural depiction gained in a previous work with Pseudomonas fluorescens (Jara et al. Front. Microbiol.

The predictive capacity for mechanical features in DPD-simulated biofilms has been investigated by varying the externally imposed field of shear strain at variable amplitude and frequency.

This pair can be considered as a bound state in the multi-well system, since it cannot decay due to single-electron tunneling transitions.

The methodology of molecular dynamics and its implementation as a tool to effectively model fluid flows inside nanocomponents is established, followed by an understanding of the intermolecular potentials which effectively model the interactions between the argon and carbon atoms. Argon is one of the most non-reactive elements in the periodic table. Being a noble gas the intermolecular interactions can be easily modeled using simple potential energy functions. The reason for using Argon lies in the simplicity in modeling its behavior and benchmarking the results with existing studies in literature. The first two cases serve to benchmark the numerical scheme by plotting the flow velocity and the structures of argon atoms while flowing inside and outside the tube. The third case simulates argon flowing from a reservoir which is twice as big as the largest dimension of the argon crystal. The simulation is carried out on short tubes with low densities of atoms. Two stages of transport are observed during the simulations. The first stage is characterized by the entry of the argon atoms into the tube which depends strongly on the repulsive forces between the argon atoms and the attractive forces between the argon and carbon tip atoms. The second stage is more chaotic as the molecules travel back and forth in the tube due to competition between the kinetic energy and the attractive potential energy of the carbon atoms on the argon. It is also observed that the argon atoms move closer to the walls of the tube. In case of higher densities they move in a coordinated fashion forming spiral-like structures. The transport is erratic and is observed in all the cases, indicating that the motion of atoms inside nanocomponents is highly randomized, yet governed solely by the intermolecular forces. ",

  "abstract": "Photoassociation of ultracold atoms is a resonant light-assisted collision process, in which two colliding atoms absorb a photon and form an excited molecule. Since the first observation about three decades ago, the photoassociation of ultracold atoms has made a significant impact on the study of ultracold atoms and molecules. Extending the photoassociation of atoms to the photoassociation of atom-molecule pairs or molecule-molecule pairs will offer many new opportunities in the study of precision polyatomic molecular spectroscopy, formation of ultracold polyatomic molecules, and quantum control of molecular collisions and reactions. However, the high density of states and the photoexcitation of the collision complex by the trapping laser make photoassociation into well-defined quantum states of polyatomic molecules extremely difficult. Here we report on the observation of photoassociation resonances in ultracold collisions between $^{23}$Na$^{40}$K molecules and $^{40}$K atoms. We perform photoassociation in a long-wavelength optical dipole trap to form deeply bound triatomic molecules in the electronically excited states. The atom-molecule Feshbach resonance is used to enhance the free-bound Franck-Condon overlap. The photoassociation into well-defined quantum states of excited triatomic molecules is identified by observing resonantly enhanced loss features. These loss features depend on the polarization of the photoassociation lasers, allowing us to assign the rotational quantum numbers. The observation of ultracold atom-molecule photoassociation resonances paves the way toward preparing ground-state triatomic molecules, provides a new high-resolution spectroscopy technique for polyatomic molecules, and is also important to atom-molecule Feshbach resonances.

We derive explicit forms of functions characterizing relaxation phenomena in the time domain - the relaxation, response and probability distribution functions. We also explain how to construct and solve relevant evolution equations within these models. These equations are usually solved by using the Schwinger parametrization and the integral transforms. Instead, in this work we replace it by the powerful Efros theorem. That allows one to relate physically admissible solutions to the memory-dependent evolution equations with phenomenologically known spectral functions and, from the other side, with the subordination mechanism emerging from a stochastic analysis of processes underpinning considered relaxation phenomena. Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of the memory-dependent evolution equations. It exploits methods of integral transforms, operational calculus and special functions theory with the completely monotone and Bernstein functions. Merging analytic and stochastic methods enables us to give a complete classification of the standard functions used to describe the large class of the relaxation phenomena and to explain their properties.

While Paper II successfully captured translational motions in CG systems using a hard sphere mapping, the absence of rotational motions in single-site CG models introduces differences between FG and CG dynamics. In this third paper, our objective is to faithfully recover atomistic diffusion coefficients from CG dynamics by incorporating rotational dynamics. By extracting FG rotational diffusion, we unravel, for the first time reported to our knowledge, a universality in excess entropy scaling between the rotational and translational diffusion. Once the missing rotational dynamics are integrated into the CG translational dynamics, an effective translation-rotation coupling becomes essential. We propose two different approaches for estimating this coupling parameter: the rough hard sphere theory with acentric factor (temperature-independent) or the rough Lennard-Jones model with CG attractions (temperature-dependent). Altogether, we demonstrate that FG diffusion coefficients can be recovered from CG diffusion coefficients by (1) incorporating \"entropy-free\" rotational diffusion with translation-rotation coupling and (2) recapturing the missing entropy.

Extensions to $2^n$-root topology, where $n$ is the number of squaring operations involved in retrieving the parent TI, were quick to follow. Here, we go one step further and develop the framework for designing general $n$-root TIs, with $n$ any positive integer, using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as the parent TI from which the higher-root versions are constructed. The method relies on using loops of unidirectional couplings as building blocks, such that the resulting model is non-Hermitian and embedded with a generalized chiral symmetry. Edge states are observed at the $n$ branches of the complex energy spectrum, appearing within what we designate as a ring gap, shown to be irreducible to the usual point or line gaps. We further detail on how such an $n$-root model can be realistically implemented in photonic ring systems. Near perfect unidirectional effective couplings between the main rings can be generated via mediating auxiliary rings with modulated gains and losses. These induce high imaginary gauge fields that strongly supress couplings in one direction, while enhancing them in the other.

In dispersive media, dissipation appears in the Schrodinger representation of Maxwell equations as a sparse diagonal operator occupying an $r$-dimensional subspace. Trotterization of the evolution enables us to isolate the non-unitary part associated with dissipation from the unitary part that corresponds to the lossless case. Given the fact that the unitary part can be implemented on $n$ qubits based on the discretization and the dimensionality of the pertinent fields we propose two dilation techniques for handling the dissipative evolution part. Our first algorithm is based on realization of dissipation as a quantum amplitude channel where an unspecified environment interacts with the lossless system and produces the non-unitary evolution. Therefore, the combined system-environment is now closed and evolves unitary. This physical unitary dilation process requires only one ancillary qubit as environment resulting in a scaling of $\\textit{O}(2^{n-1}n^2)$ elementary gates, in the implementation of the total system-environment unitary evolution operator. On the other hand, by treating the non-unitary part with the LCU method, exploiting the diagonal structure of dissipation, we obtain an optimized counterpart for the previous result. The non-unitary part can now be implemented in $\\textit{O}(2^{n})$ elementary gates.

This paper proposes to use an indicator that can not only detect the existence of a tradeoff relation but can also evaluate its strength. Based on the proposed indicator, this paper investigates the nature of the tradeoff relation in detail. ",

  "abstract": "The paper discusses Daniel Jafferis et al.'s \"Nature\" publication on \"Traversable wormhole dynamics on a quantum processor.\" The experiment utilized Google's Sycamore quantum processor to simulate a sparse SYK model with a learned Hamiltonian. A debate ensued when Bryce Kobrin, Thomas Schuster, and Norman Yao raised concerns about the learned Hamiltonian's reliability, which Jafferis and the team addressed. Recently, there has been an update in the wormhole experiment saga. In an attempt to rescue the commuting Hamiltonian from its inevitable fate of being invalidated, a recent paper by Ping Gao proposed a creative solution to reinvigorate the concept within the context of teleportation through wormholes. This paper delves into the ongoing debate and the recent endeavor to address the comments made by Kobrin et al. I remain skeptical about the efforts to address Kobrin et al.'s challenges. By its nature, a commuting Hamiltonian does not exhibit chaotic behavior like non-commuting Hamiltonians. Moreover, it's always essential to assess the sensitivity of the Hamiltonian to noise to understand its practical feasibility for the real-world Sycamore processor. ",

  "abstract": "We present QCAM, a quantum analogue of Content-Addressable Memory (CAM), useful for finding matches in two sequences of bit-strings. Our QCAM implementation takes advantage of Grover's search algorithm and proposes a highly-optimized quantum circuit implementation of the QCAM oracle. Our circuit construction uses the parallel uniformly controlled rotation gates, which were used in previous work to generate QBArt encodings. These circuits have a high degree of quantum parallelism which reduces their critical depth. The optimal number of repetitions of the Grover iterator used in QCAM depends on the number of true matches and hence is input dependent. We additionally propose a hardware-efficient implementation of the quantum counting algorithm (HEQC) that can infer the optimal number of Grover iterations from the measurement of a single observable. We demonstrate the QCAM application for computing the Jaccard similarity between two sets of k-mers obtained from two DNA sequences. ",

These terms are evaluated analytically using a newly developed, ambiguity-free, perturbative approach to the Wannier functions. We show that the density-induced tunneling generated by finite-range repulsive electron interaction can match and eventually suppress the free single-electron tunneling. However, this suppression does not lead to an insulating state, but rather to the propagation of a correlated electron pair due to the pair tunneling term of the non-standard Hubbard model. This pair can be considered as a bound state in the multi-well system, since it cannot decay due to single-electron tunneling transitions. We illustrate this by analyzing the motion of two electrons in a triple-well potential. We expect that such a pairing mechanism can be realized by finite-range repulsive interaction in many other systems. ",

Optical computing has been a topic of periodic study for over 50 years, including for neural networks three decades ago, and a wide variety of optical-computing schemes and architectures have been proposed. In this paper we provide a systematic explanation of why and how optics might be able to give speed or energy-efficiency benefits over electronics for computing, enumerating 11 features of optics that can be harnessed when designing an optical computer. One often-mentioned motivation for optical computing -- that the speed of light $c$ is fast -- is not a key differentiating physical property of optics for computing; understanding where an advantage could come from is more subtle. We discuss how gaining an advantage over state-of-the-art electronic processors will likely only be achievable by careful design that harnesses more than one of the 11 features, while avoiding a number of pitfalls that we describe.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the very existence of Berry-Maxwell equations is independent of the geometrical phase of matter waves, implying that they cannot be directly derived from the Schrodinger equation. Consequently, we propose the reciprocal electromagnetic field as a physical reality, rooted in the fundamental principles of special relativity and Gauss's law of Weyl monopoles.

Their phase diagram presents a high-temperature Coulomb (C) phase, and two low-temperature molecular (M) and Higgs (H) phases, both characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the SU($N$) symmetry. The molecular-Higgs (MH) and Coulomb-Higgs (CH) transitions are topological transitions, separating a phase with gapless gauge modes and confined charges from a phase with gapped gauge modes and deconfined charged excitations. These transitions are not described by effective Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theories, due to the active role of the gauge modes. We show that the MH and CH transitions belong to different charged universality classes. The CH transitions are associated with the $N$-dependent charged fixed point of the renormalization-group (RG) flow of the 3D Abelian-Higgs field theory (AHFT). On the other hand, the universality class of the MH transitions is independent of $N$ and coincides with that controlling the continuous transitions of the one-component ($N=1$) LAH model. In particular, we verify that the gauge critical behavior always corresponds to that observed in the 3D inverted XY model, and that the correlations of an extended charged gauge-invariant operator (in the Lorenz gauge, this operator corresponds to the scalar field, thus it is local, justifing the use of the RG framework) have an $N$-independent critical universal behavior. This scenario is supported by numerical results for $N=1,\\,2,\\,25$. The MH critical behavior does not apparently have an interpretation in terms of the RG flow of the AHFT, as determined perturbatively close to four dimensions or with standard large-$N$ methods. ",

Understanding shear band localization from microscopics is still a major challenge. One class of so-called non-local theories identified that the width of the shearing zone should depend on the stress field. We explicitly test this picture by using a uniquely stress-sensitive suspension while probing its flow behavior in a classic geometry in which shear bands can be well-tuned: the Split-Bottom Shear Cell (SBSC). The stress-sensitive suspension is composed of mildly polydisperse soft, slippery hydrogel spheres submersed in water. We measure their flow profiles and rheology while controlling the confinement stress via hydrostatic effects and compression. We determine the average angular velocity profiles in the quasi-static flow regime using Magnetic Resonance Imaging based particle image velocimetry (MRI-PIV) and discrete element method (DEM) simulations. We explicitly match a pressure-sensitive non-local granular fluidity (NGF) model to observed flow behavior. We find that shear bands for this type of suspension become extremely broad under the low confining stresses from the almost density-matched fluid particle mixture, while collapsing to a narrow shear zone under finite, externally imposed compression levels. The DEM and NGF results match the observations quantitatively, confirming the conjectured pressure sensitivity for suspensions and its role in NGF.

  "abstract": "Density functional theory calculations for the electronic structures of the 4H-SiC(0001)/SiO$_2$ interface with atomic-scale steps are carried out to investigate the effect of NO annealing. The characteristic behavior of the conduction band edge states of SiC is strongly affected over a wide area of the interface by the Coulomb interaction of the O atoms in the SiO$_2$ region as well as the step structure of the interface, resulting in the discontinuity of the inversion layers at the step edges under the gate bias. The spatially discontinued band only allows the very limited conduction paths in the inversion layer, leading to the significantly decreased mobile carrier density. It is found that the Coulomb interaction of the O atoms is screened and the inversion layers become continuous when the nitrided layers are inserted at the interface by NO annealing. This result is in good agreement with experimental findings that the improvement of the performance of SiC metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistors by NO annealing is attributed to an increase in the mobile electron density rather than an increase in the mobility of electrons in the inversion layer.

  "abstract": "First-principles density functional theory based calculations have been performed to investigate the strain-induced modifications in the electronic and vibrational properties of monolayer (ML) ZnO. Wide range of in-plane tensile and compressive strains along different directions are applied to analyse the modifications in detail. The electronic band gap reduces under both tensile and compressive strains and a direct to indirect band gap transition occurs for high values of biaxial tensile strain. The relatively low rate of decrease of band gap and large required strain for direct to indirect band gap transition compared to other $2$D materials are analysed. Systematic decrease in the frequency of the in-plane and increase in the out-of-plane optical phonon modes with increasing tensile strain are observed. The in-plane acoustic modes show linear dispersion for unstrained as well as strained cases. However, the out-of-plane acoustic mode (ZA), which shows quadratic dispersion in the unstrained condition, turns linear with strain. The dispersion of the ZA mode is analysed using the shell elasticity theory and the possibility of ripple formation with strain is analysed. The strain-induced linearity of the ZA mode indicates the absence of rippling under strain. Finally, the stability limit of ML-ZnO is investigated and found that for $18\\%$ biaxial tensile strain the structure shows instability with the emergence of imaginary phonon modes. Furthermore, the potential of ML-ZnO to be a good thermoelectric material is analyzed in an intuitive way based on the calculated electronic and phononic properties. Our results, thus, not only highlight the significance of strain-engineering in tailoring the electronic and vibrational properties but also provide a thorough understanding of the lattice dynamics and mechanical strength of ML-ZnO.

  "abstract": "Field-emission resonances (FERs) for two-dimensional Pb(111) islands grown on \\mbox{Si(111)7$\\times$7} surfaces were studied by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) in a broad range of tunneling conditions with both active and disabled feedback loop. These FERs exist at quantized sample-to-tip distances $Z^{\\,}_n$ above the sample surface, where $n$ is the serial number of the FER state. By recording the trajectory of the STM tip during ramping of the bias voltage $U$ (while keeping the tunneling current $I$ fixed), we obtain the set of the $Z^{\\,}_n$ values corresponding to local maxima in the derived $dZ/dU(U)$ spectra. This way, the continuous evolution of $Z^{\\,}_n$ as a function of $U$ for all FERs was investigated by STS experiments with active feedback loop for different $I$. Complementing these measurements by current-distance spectroscopy at a fixed $U$, we could construct a 4-dimensional $I-U-Z-dZ/dU$ diagram, that allows us to investigate the geometric localization of the FERs above the surface. We demonstrate that (i) the difference $\\delta Z^{\\,}_n=Z^{\\,}_{n+1}-Z^{\\,}_n$ between neighboring FER lines in the $Z-U$ diagram is independent of $n$ for higher resonances, (ii) the $\\delta Z^{\\,}_{n}$ value decreases as $U$ increases; (iii) the quantized FER states lead to the \\emph{periodic} variations of $\\ln I$ as a function of $Z$ with periodicity $\\delta Z$; (iv) the periodic variations in the $\\ln I - Z$ spectra allows to estimate the absolute height of the tip above the sample surface. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding on how the FER states affect various types of tunneling spectroscopy experiments and how they lead to a non-exponential decay of the tunneling current as a function of $Z$ at high bias voltages in the regime of quantized electron emission.

  "abstract": "Understanding the coordination structure of neurons in neuronal networks is essential for unraveling the distributed information processing mechanisms in brain networks. Recent advancements in measurement techniques have resulted in an increasing amount of data on neural activities recorded in parallel, revealing largely heterogeneous correlation patterns across neurons. Yet, the mechanistic origin of this heterogeneity is largely unknown because existing theoretical approaches linking structure and dynamics in neural circuits are mostly restricted to average connection patterns. Here we present a systematic inclusion of variability in network connectivity via tools from statistical physics of disordered systems. We study networks of spiking leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and employ mean-field and linear-response methods to map the spiking networks to linear rate models with an equivalent neuron-resolved correlation structure. The latter models can be formulated in a field-theoretic language that allows using disorder-average and replica techniques to systematically derive quantitatively matching beyond-mean-field predictions for the mean and variance of cross-covariances as functions of the average and variability of connection patterns. We show that heterogeneity in covariances is not a result of variability in single-neuron firing statistics but stems from the sparse realization and variable strength of connections, as ubiquitously observed in brain networks. Average correlations between neurons are found to be insensitive to the level of heterogeneity, which in contrast modulates the variability of covariances across many orders of magnitude, giving rise to an efficient tuning of the complexity of coordination patterns in neuronal circuits.

We find that these experimental phenomena sensitively depend on the particular interface reflectivity of hot electrons and may reconcile the different observations in experiment. Stimulated by the ultrafast spin currents carried by the hot electrons, we propose the multilayer structures to generate highly spin polarized currents for development of future ultrafast spintronics devices.

On one hand, Cs2AgF4 and K2CuF4 compounds (both with d9 metal cations) crystallize in an orthorhombic structure with Cmca space group and MA - F - MB bridge angle of 180, and they exhibit a weak ferromagnetism (FM) in the layer plane. On the other hand, K2NiF4 or K2MnF4 compounds (with d8 and d5 metal cations, respectively) have a tetragonal I4/mmm space group with 180 bridge angle and exhibit antiferromagnetism (AFM) in the layer plane. Firstly, we show that, contrary to what is claimed in the literature, the Cmca structure of Cs2AgF4 and K2CuF4 is not related to a cooperative Jahn-Teller effect among elongated MF64- units. Instead, first-principles calculations carried out in the I4/mmm parent phase of these two compounds show that MF64- units are axially compressed because the electrostatic potential from the rest of lattice ions force the hole to lie in the 3z2 - r2 molecular orbital (z being perpendicular to the layer plane). This fact increases the metal-ligand distance in the layer plane and makes that covalency in the bridging ligand has a residual character (clearly smaller than in K2NiF4 or KNiF3) stabilizing for only a few meV (7.9 meV for Cs2AgF4) an AFM order. However, this I4/mmm parent phase of Cs2AgF4 is unstable thus evolving towards the experimental Cmca structure with an energy gain of 140 meV, FM ordering and orthorhombic MF64- units. ",

The molecules obey Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution law. At low temperatures, for bigger brownian particles, existence of some non-random distribution for the unbalanced impulse, in itself is an interesting result.

However, the molecular details of CO$_2$ transport in these has not yet been fully unraveled. In this work, experimental studies were combined with quantum-mechanical ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanism of CO$_2$ permeation through FTMs. Various compositions of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as the membrane matrix with polyvinyl amine (PVAm), monoethanolamine (MEA), or 4-amino-1-butanol (BA) as carrier molecules were experimentally tested. Our experiments revealed that water was essential for the CO$_2$ transport and a transport superposition was achieved with a mixed composition of PVAm and MEA in PVA. Furthermore, sorption measurements with PVA were conducted with humidified N$_2$ and CO$_2$ to quantify water sorption-induced swelling and its contribution to the gas uptake. As the carbonic acid--amine interaction is assumed to cause transport facilitation, electronic structure-based ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to study the transport of CO$_2$ in the form of carbonic acid along PVAm polymer chains. In particular, the necessity of local water for transport facilitation was studied at different water contents.

In this work, we establish these patterns in one-dimensional rods undergoing longitudinal motion via a canonical transfer-matrix-based approach. In doing so, we connect the conditions underpinning bandgap emergence and closing to their physical origins in the context of the Bragg condition (for infinite media) and natural resonances (for finite counterparts). The developed framework uniquely characterizes individual bandgaps within a larger dispersion spectrum regardless of their parity (i.e., odd vs even bandgaps) or location (low vs high-frequency), by exploiting dimensionless constants of the PnC unit cell which quantify the different contrasts between its constitutive layers.

  "abstract": "We present a comprehensive study on the structure and optical properties of Mn-and Co-doped ZnO samples prepared via solid-state reaction method with different dopant concentrations and atmospheres. The samples were structural and chemically characterized via X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray excited photoelectron spectroscopy. The optical characterization was performed via Raman, photoluminescence, and diffuse photoreflectance spectroscopies. Emphasis was done on the studies of their vibrational properties. The structural data confirm the incorporation of Mn and Co ions into the wurtzite ZnO lattice. It is demonstrated that the usual observed additional bands in the Raman spectrum of transitional metal (TM) doped ZnO are related to structural damage, deriving from the doping process, and surface effects. The promoted surface optical phonons (SOP) are of Fr\\\"ohlich character and, together with the longitudinal optical (LO) polar phonons, are directly dependent on the ZnO electronic structure. The enhancement of SOP and LO modes with TM-doping is explained in terms of nonhomogeneous doping, with the dopants concentrating mainly on the surface of grains, and a resonance effect due to the decrease of the ZnO bandgap promoted by the introduction of the 3d TM levels within the ZnO bandgap. We also discuss the origin of the controversial vibrational mode commonly observed in the Mn-doped ZnO system. It is stated that the observation of the analyzed vibrational properties is a signature of substitutional doping of the ZnO structure with tuning of ZnO optical absorption into the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum.

  "abstract": "Here, based upon density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we present the basic electronic structure of CuPb9(PO4)6O (Cu-doped lead apatite), showing that the low energy (near-Fermilevel) states are dominated by Cu-O hybrid states. The filling of these states is nominally d$^{9}$, consistent with the standard Cu$^{2+}$ valence state. We find these states to be unusually flat (~ 0.2 eV dispersion), giving a very high density of electronic states (DOS) at the Fermi level that we argue can be a host for novel electronic physics, including potentially room temperature superconductivity. The states are in general sensitive to symmetry-lowering gapping possibilities that would remove the spectral weight from EF, but could be protected from this by disorder/doping heterogeneity in a real material. Importantly, this disorder is expected to be less damaging to superconductivity. Further, we claim that the emergence of these flat bands should be due to weak wavefunction overlap between the orbitals on Cu and O sites, owing to to the directional character of the constituent orbitals. Therefore, finding an appropriate host structure for minimizing hybridization between Cu and O while allowing them to still weakly interact should be a promising route for generating flat bands at EF and very high temperature superconductivity, regardless of whether LK-99 is such a realization.

We show that a straightforward perturbation theory beyond the kinetic equation gives terms that generally diverge -- go to infinity at any given wavenumber $k$, when the maximum wavenumber (UV) goes to infinity or the minimum wavenumber (IR) goes to zero. Since the power of the UV divergence increases with the order, we identify and sum the series of the most divergent diagrams, thus obtaining a new kinetic equation renormalized by multi-mode interactions. We show that the true dimensionless coupling is different from the naive estimate, and find that the effective interaction either decays or grows explosively along the cascade, depending on the sign of the new coupling. The explosive growth possibly signals the appearance of a multi-wave bound state (solitons, shocks, cusps) similar to confinement in quantum chromodynamics. ",

In addition, we propose a method for extracting information about the dissipative dynamics of a system using weak values at short dissipation times. Specifically, we explore the amplification of the dissipation rate in a two-level system and the use of weak values to differentiate between Markovian and non-Markovian dissipative dynamics.

However, this generalized holography is known to face several inconsistencies, including potential violations of causality and fundamental entropic inequalities. In this work, we address these challenges by investigating the bulk scattering process and its holographic realization. Specifically, we propose that the information on a brane/cutoff surface $Q$ propagates according to the induced light cones originating from a fictitious asymptotic boundary behind $Q$, rather than the conventional ones originating from a point on $Q$. Additionally, we establish the validity of the connected wedge theorem for generalized holography with induced light cones. We also demonstrate that entropic inequalities remain valid within the induced causal diamonds. While the induced light cone seemingly permits superluminal signaling, we argue that this causality violation can be an artifact of state preparation for radially propagating excitations, rather than local operator excitations on $Q$.

This turned on the perception that Niels Bohr avoided addressing the measurement problem by taking an instrumentalist view of quantum mechanics. I argue that this view is mistaken and Bohr's interpretation of quantum mechanics is realist. Moreover, Bohr's interpretation, which is different from textbook quantum mechanics (which is due more to Von Neumann and Paul Dirac), succeeds in solving the measurement problem. While the claim that Bohr dissolves the measurement problem within the limits of the epistemological framework he assumes has been made by a few authors, rarely has the case been made that Bohr's project unambiguously and completely overcomes the measurement problem. I make the strong case that Bohr eliminated the measurement problem altogether. For this, I put forward two new postulates through which to make sense of Bohr's interpretation. The article thus seeks to single out Bohr's interpretation from the various views that go together under the umbrella of orthodox quantum mechanics, and which have been traditionally considered susceptible to the measurement problem. It shows that Bohr's interpretation should be classified along with those like hidden variable theories, collapse models, modal interpretations etc., which offer a solution to the measurement problem and are committed to a realist ontology.

This breakthrough experimental result was enabled by the high local gain of the chalcogenide waveguides as the optoacoustic interaction length reduces with pulse width. We successfully transfer 150ps-long pulses to traveling acoustic waves within a Brillouin-based memory setup. The information encoded in the optical pulses is stored for 15 ns in the acoustic field.

The problem of an Ising model aims to determine the qubit values of the variables that minimize the objective function, and many optimization problems can be reduced to this problem. In this paper, we focus on optimization problems related to permutations, where the goal is to find the optimal permutation out of the $n!$ possible permutations of $n$ elements. To represent these problems as Ising models, a commonly employed approach is to use a kernel that utilizes one-hot encoding to find any one of the $n!$ permutations as the optimal solution. However, this kernel contains a large number of quadratic terms and high absolute coefficient values. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a novel permutation encoding technique called dual-matrix domain-wall, which significantly reduces the number of quadratic terms and the maximum absolute coefficient values in the kernel. Surprisingly, our dual-matrix domain-wall encoding reduces the quadratic term count and maximum absolute coefficient values from $n^3-n^2$ and $2n-4$ to $6n^2-12n+4$ and $2$, respectively. We also demonstrate the applicability of our encoding technique to partial permutations and Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) models.

Accordingly, LSM theorems have been reinterpreted as LSM anomalies. In this work, we provide a systematic diagnostic for LSM anomalies in one spatial dimension. We show that gauging subgroups of the global internal symmetry group of a quantum lattice model obeying an LSM anomaly delivers a dual quantum lattice Hamiltonian such that its internal and crystalline symmetries mix non-trivially through a group extension. This mixing of crystalline and internal symmetries after gauging is a direct consequence of the LSM anomaly, i.e., it can be used as a diagnostic of an LSM anomaly. We exemplify this procedure for a quantum spin-1/2 chain obeying an LSM anomaly resulting from combining a global internal $\\mathbb{Z}^{\\,}_{2}\\times\\mathbb{Z}^{\\,}_{2}$ symmetry with translation or reflection symmetry.

  "abstract": "We develop a theoretical model to calculate the quantum efficiency (QE) of photoelectron emission from materials with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) effect. In the low temperature limit, an analytical scaling between QE and the RSOC strength is obtained as QE $\\propto (\\hbar\\omega-W)^2+2E_R(\\hbar \\omega-W) -E_R^2/3$, where $\\hbar\\omega$, $W$ and $E_R$ are the incident photon energy, work function and the RSOC parameter respectively. Intriguingly, the RSOC effect substantially improves the QE for strong RSOC materials. For example, the QE of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Bi/Si(111) increases, by 149\\% and 122\\%, respectively due to the presence of strong RSOC. By fitting to the photoelectron emission characteristics, the analytical scaling law can be employed to extract the RSOC strength, thus offering a useful tool to characterize the RSOC effect in materials. Importantly, when the traditional Fowler-Dubridge model is used, the extracted results may substantially deviate from the actual values by $\\sim90\\%$, thus highlighting the importance of employing our model to analyse the photoelectron emission especially for materials with strong RSOC. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for the design of photoemitters using Rashba spintronic materials. ",

Here, we report a gate-tunable Josephson junction structure constructed from a three-dimensional (3D) niobium nano-bridge junction (NBJ) with a voltage gate on top. Measurements up to 6 K showed that the critical current of this structure can be tuned to zero by increasing {V_g}. The critical gate voltage Vgc was reduced to 16 V and may possibly be reduced further by reducing the thickness of the insulation layer between the gate and the NBJ. Furthermore, the flux modulation generated by Josephson interference of two parallel 3D NBJs can also be tuned using {V_g} in a similar manner. Therefore, we believe that this gate-tunable Josephson junction structure is promising for superconducting circuit fabrication at high integration levels. ",

Here we present its manifestation in spin waves under an easily realized condition. We show that an interface between a current-free (normal) ferromagnetic (FM) region and a current-flow (pumped) FM region can be a spin wave super-mirror whose reflection coefficient is larger than 1. The super-reflection is the consequence of current-induced spectrum inversion where phase and group velocities of spin waves are in the opposite directions. An incident spin wave activates a backward propagating refractive wave inside pumped FM region. The refractive spin wave re-enters the normal FM region to constructively interfere with the reflective wave. It appears that the pumped FM region coherently emits reflective waves, leading to a super-reflection. The process resembles superradiance of a spinning black hole through the Hawking radiation process, or Dicke superradiance of cavity photons inside population inverted media. ",

Furthermore, we present an efficient algorithm to solve the NMP that outperforms state-of-the-art network-based metrics and genetic algorithms.

Breaking the symmetry in the electron-hole tunnel density of states and creating electron-hole tunneling imbalance by biasing the device destroys the destructive interference and enables triplet Cooper-pair formation.

While other research groups have not yet replicated the superconductivity in this material, a recent Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation indicated the presence of two nearly flat bands near the Fermi level. Such flat bands are known to exhibit strongly correlated physics, which could potentially explain the reported high-$T_c$ superconductivity.

  "abstract": "A central task in finite-time thermodynamics is to minimize the excess or dissipated work, $W_{\\rm diss}$, when manipulating the state of a system immersed in a thermal bath. We consider this task for an $N$-body system, whose constituents are identical and uncorrelated at the beginning and end of the process. In the regime of slow but finite-time processes, we show that $W_{\\rm diss}$ can be dramatically reduced by considering collective protocols in which interactions are suitably created along the protocol. This can even lead to a sub-linear growth of $W_{\\rm diss}$ with $N$: $W_{\\rm diss}\\sim N^x$ with $x<1$; to be contrasted to the expected $W_{\\rm diss}\\sim N$ satisfied in any non-interacting protocol. We derive the fundamental limits to such collective advantages and show that $x=0$ is in principle possible, which however requires highly non-local $N$-body interactions. We then explore collective processes with realistic many-body interacting models, in particular a 1D spin chain and an all-to-all spin model, achieving noticeable gains under realistic levels of control. As an application of these results, we focus on the erasure of information in finite time, and prove a faster convergence to Landauer's erasure bound. ",

The payoffs of the game matrix and the aspiration are condensed into just two parameters that allow a comprehensive description of the dynamics. We find continuous and abrupt transitions in the cooperation density with excellent agreement between theory and the Gillespie simulations. Under strong selection, the system can display several levels of steady cooperation or get trapped into absorbing states. These states are still relevant for experiments even when irrational choices are made due to their prolonged relaxation times. Finally, we show that for the particular case of the Prisoner Dilemma, where defection is the dominant strategy under imitation mechanisms, the self-evaluation update instead favors cooperation nonlinearly with the level of aspiration.

The order splitting is a trading strategy to execute their large potential metaorder into small pieces to reduce transaction cost. This strategic behavior is believed to be important because it is a promising candidate for the microscopic origin of the long-range correlation (LRC) in the persistent order flow. Indeed, in 2005, Lillo, Mike, and Farmer (LMF) introduced a microscopic model of the order-splitting traders to predict the asymptotic behavior of the LRC from the microscopic dynamics, even quantitatively. The plausibility of this scenario has been qualitatively investigated by Toth et al. 2015. However, no solid support has been presented yet on the quantitative prediction by the LMF model in the lack of large microscopic datasets. In this report, we have provided the first quantitative statistical analysis of the order-splitting behavior at the level of each trading account. We analyse a large dataset of the Tokyo stock exchange (TSE) market over nine years, including the account data of traders (called virtual servers). The virtual server is a unit of trading accounts in the TSE market, and we can effectively define the trader IDs by an appropriate preprocessing. We apply a strategy clustering to individual traders to identify the order-splitting traders and the random traders. For most of the stocks, we find that the metaorder length distribution obeys power laws with exponent $\\alpha$, such that $P(L)\\propto L^{-\\alpha-1}$ with the metaorder length $L$.

Recently, IBM used a superconducting quantum computer to simulate a kicked quantum Ising model for large numbers of qubits and time steps. By employing powerful error mitigation techniques, they were able to obtain an excellent agreement with the exact solution of the model. This result is very surprising, considering that the total error accumulated by the circuit is prohibitively large. In this letter, we address this paradox by introducing a dissipative mean-field approximation based on Kraus operators. Our effective theory reproduces the many-body unitary dynamics and matches quantitatively local and non-local observables. These findings demonstrate that the observed dynamics is equivalent to a single qubit undergoing rotations and dephasing.

Most studies on quantum error mitigation have been focused on the resource cost due to its exponential scaling in the circuit depth. However, as methods such as probabilistic error cancellation rely on discretizing the evolution into finite time steps and applying the mitigation layer after each time step, modifying only the noise part without any Hamiltonian-dependence, there may be Trotter-like errors in the simulation results even if the error mitigation is implemented ideally, meaning that the number of samples is taken as infinite. Here we analyze the aforementioned errors which have been largely neglected and show that, they are determined by the commutating relations between the superoperators of the unitary part, the device noise part and the noise part of the open dynamics to be simulated. We include both digital quantum simulation and analog quantum simulation setups, and consider defining the ideal error mitigation map both by exactly inverting the noise channel and by approximating it to the first order in the time step. We take single-qubit toy models to numerically demonstrate our findings.

In this paper, we present a Generalized Quantum Signal Processing (GQSP) approach, employing general SU(2) rotations as our signal processing operators, rather than relying solely on rotations in a single basis. Our approach lifts all practical restrictions on the family of achievable transformations, with the sole remaining condition being that $|P|\\leq 1$, a restriction necessary due to the unitary nature of quantum computation. Furthermore, GQSP provides a straightforward recursive formula for determining the rotation angles needed to construct the polynomials in cases where $P$ and $Q$ are known.

In this paper, we calculate the topological entropy suggested by Kitaev and Preskill for these states together with a new entropy based on a reduced density matrix that we propose as a measure to distinguish topological one-electron states. Our results show that the topological entropy is a constant independent of the parameters that characterize a topological state as its angular momentum, longitudinal wave vector, and radius of the nanowire. The new entropy is always larger for topological states than for normal ones, allowing the identification of the topological ones. We show how the reduced density matrices associated with both entropies are constructed from the pure state using positive maps and explicitly obtaining the Krauss operators. ",

In contrast to common optimization-based methods for searching circuit parameters (angles), here we consider choosing them at random.

Investigation of this effect has led us to the following conjecture: given the probability distribution of obtaining distinct objective values, random parameters QAOA for QUSO problems always gives a higher entropy of this distribution than the classical random search.

The ability to accurately and reliably prepare specific quantum states is essential for various applications. One of the promising applications of quantum computers is quantum simulation. This requires preparing a quantum state representing the system we are trying to simulate. This research introduces a novel simulation algorithm, the multi-Split-Steps Quantum Walk (multi-SSQW), designed to learn and load complicated probability distributions using parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) with a variational solver on classical simulators. The multi-SSQW algorithm is a modified version of the split-steps quantum walk, enhanced to incorporate a multi-agent decision-making process, rendering it suitable for modeling financial markets. The study provides theoretical descriptions and empirical investigations of the multi-SSQW algorithm to demonstrate its promising capabilities in probability distribution simulation and financial market modeling. Harnessing the advantages of quantum computation, the multi-SSQW models complex financial distributions and scenarios with high accuracy, providing valuable insights and mechanisms for financial analysis and decision-making. The multi-SSQW's key benefits include its modeling flexibility, stable convergence, and instantaneous computation. These advantages underscore its rapid modeling and prediction potential in dynamic financial markets. ",

Given finite statistics, experimental data cannot give perfect information about the quantum state. A common way to express this limited knowledge is by providing confidence regions in state space. Though plenty of confidence regions have been previously proposed, they are often too loose to use for large systems or difficult to apply to nonstandard measurement schemes. Starting from a vector Bernstein inequality, we consider concentration bounds for random vectors following multinomial distributions and analyse optimal strategies to distribute a fixed budget of samples across them. Interpreting this as a tomography experiment leads to two confidence regions, one of which performs comparably well to the best regions in the literature. The regions describe an ellipsoid in the state space and have the appeal of being efficient in the required number of samples as well as being easily applicable to any measurement scheme. ",

The four--current in the Maxwell equations and the mass in the electronic Dirac equation also force the electromagnetic field to transform differently to the electronic field.

We demonstrate that such an algorithm would eventually solve the open question regarding dimension 6 with finite memory, although it still remains intractable. We explore the idea that to show the inexistence of bases, it suffices to search for orthonormal vector sets of certain smaller sizes, rather than full bases. We use our two methods to conjecture the minimum set sizes required to show infeasibility, proving it for dimensions 3. The fact that such sub-problems seem to also be infeasible heavily reduces the number of variables, by 66\\% in the case of the open problem, potentially providing an large speedup for other algorithms and bringing them into the realm of tractability.

Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving (HPTP) maps are considered as the local dynamic maps beyond CPTP. In this paper, we provide a succinct answer to the question of what physical maps are in the HPTP realm by two approaches. The first is by taking one step out of the CPTP set, which provides us with Semi-Positivity (SP) TP maps. The second way is by examining the physicality of HPTP maps, which leads to Semi-Nonnegative (SN) TP maps. Physical interpretations and geometrical structures are studied for these maps. The non-CP SPTP maps $\\Psi$ correspond to the quantum non-Markovian process under the CP-divisibility definition ($\\Psi = \\Xi \\circ \\Phi^{-1}$, where $\\Xi$ and $\\Phi$ are CPTP). When removing the invertibility assumption on $\\Phi$, we land in the set of SNTP maps. A by-product of set relations is an answer to the following question -- what kind of dynamics the system will go through when the previous dynamic $\\Phi$ is non-invertible. In this case, the only locally well-defined maps are in $SN\\backslash SP$, they live on the boundary of $SN$. Otherwise, the non-local information will be irreplaceable in the system's dynamic. With the understanding of physical maps beyond CPTP, we prove that the current quantum error correction scheme is still sufficient to correct quantum non-Markovian errors. In some special cases, lack of complete positivity could provide us with more error correction methods with less overhead. ",

The first two features arise from dropping the classical independence assumption, and the third feature arises from dropping the quantum-mechanical conditions that are imposed in the construction of the GOE. In particular, the hermiticity condition, which in the present model, is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the eigenvalues to be real, is not imposed. Consequently, complex non-Hermitian 2 X 2 random matrices with real or complex eigenvalues can also have spacing distributions that are intermediate between those of the Poisson and Wigner classes.

Monoclinic phases have been actively invoked to describe the phase boundaries such as Morphotropic Phase Boundary in functional perovskite oxides. These phases are believed to play the major role in the enhancement of functional properties such as dielectricity and electromechanical coupling through rotation of spontaneous polarization and modification of the rich domain microstructures. Unfortunately, such microstructures remain poorly understood due to the complexity of the subject. The goal of this work is to formulate the geometrical laws behind the monoclinic domain microstructures. Specifically, we implement the result of our previous work (Gorfman et al, 2022) to catalogue and outline some properties of permissible domain walls that connect strain domains with monoclinic (MAB type) symmetry, occurring in ferroelectric perovskite oxides. The term permissible (Fousek & Janovec, 1969) pertains to the domain walls, connecting a pair of strain domains without a lattice mismatch. We found that 12 monoclinic domains may form pairs connected along 84 types of permissible domain walls. These contain 48 domain walls with fixed Miller indices (known as W-walls) and 36 domain walls whose Miller indices may change when free lattice parameters change as well (known as S-walls). We provide simple analytical expressions for the orientation of these domain walls, the matrices of transformation between crystallographic basis vectors and for the separation between Bragg peaks, diffracted from each of the pairs of domains, connected along 84 permissible domain walls. The resultscan contribute to the understanding and facilitate investigation of complex monoclinic domain microstructures. ",

We here present an alternative closure that is rather based upon the first moment, and gives rise to an even simpler constitutive equation. We establish that both closures are physically sound, since both can be derived from (different) well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles, and both are consistent with the Second Law of thermodynamics. In contrast to the standard model, the new model has a free energy and a dissipation rate that are both regular at vanishing conformation tensor. We speculate that this might perhaps alleviate the well-known high Weissenberg number problem, i. e. severe numerical instabilities of the standard model at large flow rates. As the new model permits a trivial solution (vanishing conformation tensor, vanishing polymer stress), an extension may be needed, which includes Langevin noise in order to model thermal fluctuations.

In two dimensions, any amount of disorder is thought to induce localization of all states at long enough length scales, though this may be prevented if bands are topological or have strong spin-orbit coupling. In this note, we present a simple argument providing another mechanism for disrupting localization: by tuning the underlying curvature of the manifold on which diffusion takes place. We show that negative curvature manifolds contain a natural infrared cut off for the probability of self returning paths. We provide explicit calculations of the Cooperon -- directly related to the weak-localization corrections to the conductivity -- in hyperbolic space. It is shown that constant negative curvature leads to a rapid growth in the number of available trajectories a particle can coherently traverse in a given time, reducing the importance of interference effects and restoring classical diffusive behavior even in the absence of inelastic collisions. We conclude by arguing that this result may be amenable to experimental verification through the use of quantum simulators. ",

The limit assumes that the total number the disks increases infinitely, while the mean density of the disk centers and the range of the size distribution are kept constant. The structure factor dependence on momentum transfer is investigated for various numbers of disks and extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit. The fractal power-law decay of the structure factor is recovered in momentum space within the fractal range, which corresponds to the range of the size distribution in real space. The fractal exponent coincides with the exponent of the power-law size distribution as was shown previously by the authors [Cherny, Anitas, Osipov, J. Chem. Phys. 158 (4), 044114 (2023)]. The finite-size effects are also studied at very small momentum of order of the inverse system size. We show that the structure factor is parabolic in this region and calculate the prefactor analytically. The obtained results reveal fractal-like properties of the packing. Our findings can be used to analyze small-angle scattering from such systems. ",

  "abstract": "Achieving reliable and quantifiable performance in large-area surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates has long been a formidable challenge. It requires substantial signal enhancement while maintaining a reproducible and uniform response. Conventional SERS substrates are typically made of inhomogeneous materials with random resonator geometries and distributions. As a result, they exhibit several or broadened plasmonic resonances, undesired absorptive losses, and inhomogeneous field enhancement. These limitations diminish the signal strength and hamper reproducibility, making it difficult to conduct comparative studies with high sensitivity. In this study, we propose an approach that utilizes monocrystalline gold flakes to fabricate well-defined gratings composed of plasmonic double-wire resonators, which are fabricated through focused ion-beam lithography. The geometry of the double wire grating substrate (DWGS) was evolutionary optimized to achieve efficient enhancement for both excitation and emission processes. The use of monocrystalline material minimizes absorption losses while enhancing the shape fidelity during the nanofabrication process. The DWGS shows notable reproducibility (RSD=6.6%), repeatability (RSD=5.6%), and large-area homogeneity over areas $>10^4\\,\\mu$m$^2$. Moreover, it provides a SERS enhancement factor of $\\approx 10^6$ for 4-Aminothiophenol (4-ATP) analyte and detection capability for sub-monolayer coverage.

With S-acceleration, part semantic features from machine-setting parameters and physics-effects informed characteristics are explored for measuring mutual part similarities. A user-defined simplification rate of experiments is proposed to purposely remove redundant parts before conducting experiments printing without sacrificing information gain as original full factorial experiment design. This S-acceleration design of experiments is demonstrated on a Concept Laser M2 machine for the experimental plan of modeling relationships between process parameters and part porosity defects. The printed part has 2 mm diameter by 4 mm tall pin geometry considering variations in build location and orientation, laser settings and powder feedstock are held constant.

In systems with all-to-all interactions, a phase where a fixed point is always reached and a dynamically-fluctuating phase have been found.

Here we show that a new type of phase appears in the phase diagram, where for the same control parameters different communities may reach either a fixed point or a state where the abundances of a finite subset of species fluctuate, and calculate the probability for each outcome. These fluctuating species are organized around short cycles in the interaction graph, and their abundances undergo large non-linear fluctuations. We characterize the approach from this phase to a phase with extensively many fluctuating species, and show that the probability of fluctuations grows continuously to one as the transition is approached, and that the number of fluctuating species diverges. This is qualitatively distinct from the transition to extensive fluctuations coming from a fixed point phase, which is marked by a loss of linear stability. The differences are traced back to the emergent binary character of the dynamics when far away from short cycles in the local fluctuations phase. ",

This step typically relies on an accurate $\\textit{in-situ}$ estimation of signal losses in the experimental set-up and requires a careful photon number calibration.

  "abstract": "Single-photon sources based on semiconductor quantum dots find several applications in quantum information processing due to their high single-photon indistinguishability, on-demand generation, and low multiphoton emission. In this context, the generation of entangled photons represents a challenging task with a possible solution relying on the interference in probabilistic gates of identical photons emitted at different pulses from the same source. In this work, we implement this approach via a simple and compact design that generates entangled photon pairs in the polarization degree of freedom. We operate the proposed platform with single photons produced through two different pumping schemes, the resonant excited one and the longitudinal-acoustic phonon-assisted configuration. We then characterize the produced entangled two-photon states by developing a complete model taking into account relevant experimental parameters, such as the second-order correlation function and the Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility. Our source shows long-term stability and high quality of the generated entangled states, thus constituting a reliable building block for optical quantum technologies. ",

  "abstract": "Information causality was initially proposed as a physical principle aimed at deriving the predictions of quantum mechanics on the type of correlations observed in the Bell experiment. In the same work, information causality was famously shown to imply the Uffink inequality that approximates the set of quantum correlations and rederives Tsirelson's bound of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality. This result found limited generalizations due to the difficulty of deducing implications of the information causality principle on the set of nonlocal correlations. In this paper, we present a simple technique for obtaining polynomial inequalities from information causality, bounding the set of physical correlations in any Bell scenario. To demonstrate our method, we derive a family of inequalities which non-trivially constrains the set of nonlocal correlations in Bell scenarios with binary outcomes and equal number of measurement settings. Finally, we propose an improved statement of the information causality principle, obtain tighter constraints for the simplest Bell scenario that goes beyond the Uffink inequality, and recovers a part of the boundary of the quantum set.

However, superconductors at normal temperatures have yet to be identified. Additionally, there are still many unknown factors and gaps of understanding regarding this unique phenomenon, particularly the connection between superconductivity and the fundamental criteria to estimate the critical temperature. To bridge the gap, numerous machine learning techniques have been established to estimate critical temperatures as it is extremely challenging to determine. Furthermore, the need for a sophisticated and feasible method for determining the temperature range that goes beyond the scope of the standard empirical formula appears to be strongly emphasized by various machine-learning approaches. This paper uses a stacking machine learning approach to train itself on the complex characteristics of superconductive materials in order to accurately predict critical temperatures. In comparison to other previous accessible research investigations, this model demonstrated a promising performance with an RMSE of 9.68 and an R2 score of 0.922.

Specifically, in the strong-coupling limit, the bipolarons can freely slide within a degenerate manifold rather than become self-trapped. A gas of these bipolarons can undergo a superfluid transition at a critical temperature for which we derive an upper bound.

  "abstract": "We study an unique form of metallic ferromagnetism in which orbital moments surpasses the role of spin moments in shaping the overall magnetization. This system emerges naturally upon doping a topologically non-trivial Chern band in the recently identified quarter metal phase of rhombohedral trilayer graphene. Our comprehensive scan of the density-interlayer potential parameter space reveals an unexpected landscape of orbital magnetization marked by two sign changes and a line of singularities. The sign change originates from an intense Berry curvature concentrated close to the band-edge, and the singularity arises from a topological Lifshitz transition that transform a simply connected Fermi sea into an annular Fermi sea. Importantly, these variations occur while the groundstate order-parameter (i.e.~valley and spin polarization) remains unchanged. This unconventional relationship between the order parameter and magnetization markedly contrasts traditional spin ferromagnets, where spin magnetization is simply proportional to the groundstate spin polarization via the gyromagnetic ratio. We compute energy and magnetization curves as functions of collective valley rotation to shed light on magnetization dynamics and to expand the Stoner-Wohlfarth magnetization reversal model. We provide predictions on the magnetic coercive field that can be readily tested in experiments. Our results challenge established perceptions of magnetism, emphasising the important role of orbital moments in two-dimensional materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides, and in turn, expand our understanding and potential manipulation of magnetic behaviors in these systems.

In a typical BG set-up with an isotropic colloidal particle, the anisotropy sets in by the coupling among space dimensions via an externally applied anisotropic potential confining the particle and the difference between the temperatures along various space dimensions. The coupling is conservative. Here, contrary to a typical BG, first we consider an over-damped, anisotropic colloidal particle (a Brownian ellipsoid), trapped in an isotropic harmonic potential in two dimensions (2D). The space dimensions are coupled by the difference between the longitudinal and transverse frictional drags experienced by the ellipsoid, together with a finite tilt in its orientation due to its chirality. The coupling is dissipative. They are intrinsic properties of the particle. We have shown that this dissipative coupling can generate enough anisotropic fluctuations to perform a steady-state gyration in the Brownian scale. Next, going beyond BG, we have considered an inertial, granular, chiral ellipsoid in 2D, subjected to athermal, anisotropic fluctuations. There is no trapping force confining the granular ellipsoid. However, the coupling between the velocity components of the granular ellipsoid is still dissipative. We have shown that being assisted by the dissipative coupling and the anisotropic fluctuations, the inertial, granular ellipsoid can also perform gyration in 2D. We have also shown that the dominant contribution towards the gyrating frequency can be attributed to the Coriolis force acting on the granular ellipsoid. Hence, the gyrator in the granular scale is also a tiny autonomous machine that generates a directed motion (gyration) from fluctuations. Although there are fundamental differences between the two.

Analysis of those data with the classical nucleation theory revealed a significant increase of the kinetic prefactor in the same order as the complexation constants of calcium and silicate with each of the organics. Finally, two distinct precipitation regimes of the C-S-H amorphous precursor were identified: i) a nucleation regime at low saturation indexes (SI) and ii) a spinodal nucleation regime at high SI where the free energy barrier to the phase transition is found to be of the order of the kinetic energy or less.

Despite their simplicity, these models showcase an intricate array of phenomena, including pump and heat engine regimes as well as a discontinuous phase transition. We will look at three distinctive topologies: a minimal and beyond minimal (homogeneous and heterogeneous interaction structures). The former case is represented by stark different networks (\"all-to-all\" interactions and only a central interacting to its neighbors) and present exact solutions, whereas homogeneous and heterogeneous structures have been analyzed by numerical simulations. We find that the topology plays a major role on the thermodynamic performance if the individual energies of the quantum dots are small, in part due to the presence of first-order phase-transitions. If the individual energies are large, the topology is not important and results are well-described by a system with all-to-all interactions. ",

  "abstract": "Topological insulators have been extended to higher-order versions that possess topological hinge or corner states in lower dimensions. However, their robustness against disorder is still unclear. Here, we theoretically investigate the phase transitions of three-dimensional (3D) chiral second-order topological insulator (SOTI) in the presence of disorders. Our results show that, by increasing disorder strength, the nonzero densities of states of side surface and bulk emerge at critical disorder strengths of $W_{S}$ and $W_{B}$, respectively. The spectral function indicates that the bulk gap is only closed at one of the $R_{4z}\\mathcal{T}$-invariant points, i.e., $\\Gamma_{3}$. The closing of side surface gap or bulk gap is ascribed to the significant decrease of the elastic mean free time of quasi-particles. Because of the localization of side surface states, we find that the 3D chiral SOTI is robust at an averaged quantized conductance of $2e^{2}/h$ with disorder strength up to $W_{B}$. When the disorder strength is beyond $W_{B}$, the 3D chiral SOTI is then successively driven into two phases, i.e., diffusive metallic phase and Anderson insulating phase. Furthermore, an averaged conductance plateau of $e^{2}/h$ emerges in the diffusive metallic phase. ",

We compare the analytical expression for the scaling function with simulation data to deduce about the domains of diffusion and localization regimes. In 1D, it is shown that conductance drops dramatically at the quartic band edge compared to a quadratic band. As for the Q1D nanoribbons, a set of singularities emerge close to the band edge, which suppress conductance and lead to short mean-free-paths and localization lengths. Interestingly, wider nanoribbons can have shorter mean-free-paths because of denser singularities. However, the localization lengths do not necessarily follow the same trend.

In the field of materials science, synthetic soft composites are promising candidates for constructing various engineering devices due to their highly programmable features. However, when the volume fraction of inclusions increases, predicting the mechanical properties of these materials poses a significant challenge for the classical theories in composite mechanics. The difficulty arises from the inherently disordered, multi-scale interactions between the inclusions and matrix. To address this challenge, we conducted systematic investigations on the mechanics of densely-filled soft elastomers containing stiff microspheres. We experimentally demonstrated how the strain-stiffening response of the soft composites is governed by the critical scalings in the vicinity of a continuous phase transition, which depend on both the elasticity of the elastomer matrix and the particles. The critical points signify a shear-jamming transition of the included particles in the absence of matrix elasticity. The proposed criticality framework quantitatively predicts diverse mechanical responses observed in experiments across a wide range of material parameters. The findings uncover a novel design paradigm of composite mechanics that relies on engineering the jamming-criticality of the embedded inclusions. ",

Motivated by this picture, we build a two-orbital Hubbard model on a triangular lattice formed by the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals with total hole density (summed over spin and orbital) $n=1-p$. When $p=0$, the system is in a Mott insulator within this model. When $p>0$, we derive a $t-J$ model and perform a self-consistent slave boson mean field calculation. Interestingly we find a s-wave pairing in contrast to the one-orbital t-J model which favors $d+id$ pairing. S wave pairing should be more robust to disorder and may lead to high Tc superconductor with sufficiently large values of $t$ and $J$. However, the DFT calculations predict a very small value of $t$ and then the $T_c$ is expected to be small. If LK99 is really a high Tc superconductor, ingredients beyond the current model are needed. We conjecture that the doped Cu atoms may distort the original lattice and form local clusters with smaller Cu -Cu distance and thus larger values of $t$ and $J$.

Here, we present resistance measurements proving that a dome of superconductivity surrounds the charge-density-wave (CDW) QCP in pristine samples of 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ tuned with hydrostatic pressure. Furthermore, we use quantum oscillation measurements to show that the superconductivity sets in at a Lifshitz transition in the electronic band structure.

To understand chemical processes in heterogeneous catalysis or on-surface polymerization the study of bond dissociation in molecules adsorbed on crystalline surfaces is advantageous.

Bond breaking in single adsorbed molecules can be triggered using the energy of the tunnelling electrons in a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) at selected positions to investigate the dissociation dynamics. Single bond dissociation dynamics has been deeply investigated only in small molecules, but not in larger molecules that exhibit distinct rotational degrees of freedom.

This rod-like molecule allows to clearly identify not only displacement of the reaction fragments, but also their rotation. The results show that the molecular fragment binds to the nearest silver atom and only further rotation is allowed. Moreover, the excitation responsible for the bond breaking can propagate through the molecular backbone to dissociate a bromine atom that is not located at the pulse position.

Surface codes emerge robust to both bit and phase flip errors. Among them, rotated surface codes perform best with higher thresholds attributed to simplicity and lower qubit overhead. The noise threshold, or the point at which QECCs become ineffective, surpasses the error rate found in contemporary quantum processors.

Surprisingly, it is shown that these seemingly detrimental factors can provide substantial advantages in the operation of quantum machine learning algorithms under certain circumstances. Exploring and understanding the implications of adapting quantum machine learning algorithms to open quantum systems opens up pathways for devising strategies that effectively leverage noise and dissipation. The recent works analyzed in this Perspective represent only initial steps towards uncovering other potential hidden benefits that dissipation and noise may offer. As exploration in this field continues, significant discoveries are anticipated that could reshape the future of quantum computing. ",

  "abstract": "Randomness extraction is an essential post-processing step in practical quantum cryptography systems. When statistical fluctuations are taken into consideration, the requirement of large input data size could heavily penalise the speed and resource consumption of the randomness extraction process, thereby limiting the overall system performance. In this work, we propose a sampled sub-block hashing approach to circumvent this problem by randomly dividing the large input block into multiple sub-blocks and processing them individually. Through simulations and experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in system throughput while keeping the resource utilisation low. Furthermore, our proposed approach is applicable to a generic class of quantum cryptographic protocols that satisfy the generalised entropy accumulation framework, presenting a highly promising and general solution for high-speed post-processing in quantum cryptographic applications such as quantum key distribution and quantum random number generation.

  "abstract": "The manner in which probability amplitudes of paths sum up to form wave functions of orbital angular momentum eigenstates is described. Using a generalization of stationary-phase analysis, distributions are derived that provide a measure of how paths contribute towards any given eigenstate. In the limit of long travel-time, these distributions turn out to be real-valued, non-negative functions of a momentum variable that describes classical travel between the endpoints of a path (with the paths explicitly including nonclassical ones, described in terms of elastica). The distributions are functions of both this characteristic momentum as well as a polar angle that provides a tilt, relative to the z-axis of the chosen coordinate system, of the geodesic that connects the endpoints. The resulting description provides a replacement for the well-known \"vector model\" for describing orbital angular momentum, and importantly, it includes treatment of the case when the quantum number $\\ell$ is zero (i.e., s-states).

Furthermore, GKP states not only enable close-to-optimal quantum communication rates in bosonic channels, but also allow for error correction of an oscillator into many oscillators. This review focuses on the basic working mechanism, performance characterization, and the many applications of GKP codes, with emphasis on recent experimental progress in superconducting circuit architectures and theoretical progress in multimode GKP qubit codes and oscillators-to-oscillators (O2O) codes. We begin with a preliminary continuous-variable formalism needed for bosonic codes. We then proceed to the quantum engineering involved to physically realize GKP states. We take a deep dive into GKP stabilization and preparation in superconducting architectures and examine proposals for realizing GKP states in the optical domain (along with a concise review of GKP realization in trapped-ion platforms). Finally, we present multimode GKP qubits and GKP-O2O codes, examine code performance and discuss applications of GKP codes in quantum information processing tasks such as computing, communication, and sensing.

  "abstract": "A fully local quantum account of the interactions experienced between charges requires us to use all the four modes of the electromagnetic vector potential, in the Lorenz gauge. However, it is frequently stated that only the two transverse modes of the vector potential are ``real\" in that they contain photons that can actually be detected. The photons present in the other two modes, the scalar and the longitudinal, are considered unobservable, and are referred to as ``virtual particles\" or ``ghosts\". Here we argue that this view is erroneous and that even these modes can, in fact, be observed. We present an experiment which is designed to measure the entanglement generated between a charge and the scalar modes. This entanglement is a direct function of the number of photons present in the scalar field. Our conclusion therefore is that the scalar quantum variables are as ``real\" as the transverse ones, where reality is defined by their ability to affect the charge. A striking consequence of this is that we cannot detect by local means a superposition of a charge bigger than that containing 137 electrons. ",

Finding a proper description for the precision of sequential measurement sensing is very challenging as it requires the analysis of long sequences with exponentially large outcomes. Here, we develop a recursive formula and an efficient Monte-Carlo approach to calculate the Fisher information, as a figure of merit for sensing precision, for arbitrary lengths of sequential measurements.

Quantum computing simulations on classical computers require long performance times, especially for quantum circuits with a large number of qubits or when simulating a large number of shots for noise simulations or circuits with intermediate measures.

  "abstract": "Photons can undergo spin-orbit coupling, by which the polarization (spin) and spatial profile (orbit) of the electromagnetic field interact and mix. Strong photonic spin-orbit coupling may reportedly arise from light propagation confined in a small cross-section, where the optical modes feature spin-orbit entanglement. However, while photonic Hamiltonians generally exhibit nonlinearity, the role and implication of spin-orbit entanglement in nonlinear optics have received little attention and are still elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of nonlinear optical frequency conversion, where spin-orbit entanglement facilitates spin-to-orbit transfer among different optical frequencies. By pumping a multimode optical nanofiber with a spin-polarized Gaussian pump beam, we produce an optical vortex at the third harmonic, which has long been regarded as a forbidden process in isotropic media. Our findings offer a unique and powerful means for efficient optical vortex generation that only incorporates a single Gaussian pump beam, in sharp contrast to any other approaches employing structured pump fields or sophisticatedly designed media. Our work opens up new possibilities of spin-orbit-coupling subwavelength waveguides, inspiring fundamental studies of nonlinear optics involving various types of structured light, as well as paving the way for the realization of hybrid quantum systems comprised of telecom photonic networks and long-lived quantum memories.

The different regimes can be identified by examining nematic ordering, cluster size, number of pinned particles, and transverse diffusion. In some regimes we find that the pinning can enhance the particle alignment, producing a nonmonotonic signature in the nematic ordering with a maximum at a particular combination of pinning density and drive. The optimal nematic occurs when a sufficient number of particles can be pinned, generating a local shear and leading to what we call a combing effect. At high drives, the combing effect is reduced when the number of pinned particles decreases. For stronger pinning, the particles form a heterogeneous clustered or clogged state that depins into a fluctuating state with high diffusion. ",

The flat bands emerge at a discrete set of magic twist angles and feature properties intrinsically distinct from those realized in twisted bilayer graphene.

Two degenerate flat bands with Chern numbers $C_A=2$ and $C_B=-1$ arise at odd magic angles, whereas even magic angles display four flat bands, with Chern number $C_{A/B}=\\pm1$, together with a Dirac cone crossing at zero energy. All bands are sublattice polarized. We demonstrate the structure behind these flat bands and obtain analytical expressions for the wavefunctions in all cases. Each magic angle is identified with the vanishing of a zero-mode wavefunction at high-symmetry position and momentum. The whole analytical structure results from whether the vanishing is linear or quadratic for the, respectively, odd and even magic angle. The $C_{3z}$ and $C_{2y}T$ symmetries are shown to play a key role in establishing the flat bands.

This striking transport phenomenon occurs in electronic systems with topologically nontrivial bands and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Discovery of its putative fractional counterpart in the presence of strong electron correlations, i.e., the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, would open a new chapter in condensed matter physics. Here, we report the direct observation of both integer and fractional QAH effects in electrical measurements on twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. At zero magnetic field, near filling factor $\\nu = -1$ (one hole per moir\\'e unit cell) we see an extended integer QAH plateau in the Hall resistance $R_\\text{xy}$ that is quantized to $h/e^2 \\pm 0.1 \\%$ while the longitudinal resistance $R_\\text{xx}$ vanishes.

Most droplet research focuses on untrapped or weakly trapped scenarios, where the droplets exhibit a liquid-like flat density profile. When weakly trapped droplets rotate, they usually respond through center-of-mass motion or splitting instability. Here, we study rapidly rotating droplets in the strong external confinement limit where the external potential prevents splitting and the center-of-mass excitation. We find that quantum droplets form a triangular vortex lattice as in single-component repulsive Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), but the overall density follows the analytical Thomas-Fermi profile obtained from a cubic equation. We observe three significant differences between rapidly rotating droplets and repulsive BECs. First, the vortex core size changes markedly at finite density, visible in numerically obtained density profiles. We analytically estimate the vortex core sizes from the droplets' coherence length and find good agreement with the numerical results. Second, the change in the density profile gives a slight but observable distortion to the lattice, which agrees with the distortion expected due to nonuniform superfluid density. Lastly, unlike a repulsive BEC, which expands substantially as the rotation frequency approaches the trapping frequency, rapidly rotating droplets show only a fractional change in their size. We argue that this last point can be used to create clouds with lower filling factors, which may facilitate reaching the elusive strongly correlated regime. ",

We also measure the skyrmion velocity-current curves and identify the signatures of different phases including a pinned phase, stable soliton motion, and quasi-free motion at higher drives where all of the skyrmions depin from the pinning centers and move along the rigid wall. In the quasi-free motion regime, the velocity is oscillatory due to the motion of the skyrmions over the pinning sites. For increasing pinning strength, the onset of soliton motion shifts to higher values of current density. We also find that for stronger pinning, the characteristic velocity-current shape is affected by the annihilation of single or multiple skyrmions in the drive interval over which the soliton motion occurs.

This study employs first-principles calculations, cluster expansion techniques, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the Li+ transport properties in DRX Li2-xVO3, where 0 <= x <= 1. Our findings underscore (i) the necessity of accounting for both tetrahedral and octahedral Li occupancy when predicting the transport properties in DRX materials, (ii) the factors influencing the variation in the diffusion coefficients with Li content in Li2-xVO3, and (iii) the impact of Li+ correlated motion on the kinetics of Li+ transport.

Under additional gravitational potential, the hexatic phase transitions into a quasi-diamond two-unit basis. In-situ imaging reveal this phase transition is initiated by an out-of-plane rotation of a particle at a crystalline defect and causes a chain reaction of neighboring particle rotations. Our results provide a framework of studying different structures from hard-particle self-assembly and demonstrates the ability to use confinement to induce unusual phases. ",

We present evidence for high-temperature superconductivity in binary La4H23 with A15-type structure featuring hydrogen cages at a pressure of P = 95 GPa. We synthesise La4H23 from a lanthanum film capped with a palladium catalyst promoting the dissociation of hydrogen.

In X-ray diffraction on the same sample, we identify the A15-type cubic body centred structure of the lanthanum sublattice.

We visualize the resulting maximally-localized exciton Wannier functions (MLXWFs) in real space, detail the convergence of the exciton Wannier spreads, and demonstrate how Wannier-Fourier interpolation can be leveraged to obtain exciton energies and states at arbitrary exciton crystal momenta in the Brillouin zone. We further introduce an approach to treat the long-range dipolar coupling between singlet MLXWFs and discuss it in depth. The MLXWF representation sheds light on the fundamental nature of excitons and paves the way towards Wannier-based post-processing of excitonic properties, enabling the construction of ab initio exciton tight-binding models, efficient interpolation of the exciton-phonon vertex, the computation of Berry curvature associated with exciton bands, and beyond.

While the temporal component of the gauge field plays a role of a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the no double occupancy constraint, the spatial components do that to enforce the zero counterflow constraint of the spinon and holon currents. The BRST quantization guarantees the gauge invariance of the theory and removes the redundant gauge degrees of freedom by proper gauge fixing conditions while the no double occupancy and zero counterflow constraints are exactly retained. Furthermore, Fradkin-Vilkovisky gauge fixing conditions endow the gauge field with dynamics. This turns the strongly correlated electron model into a weakly coupled slave boson model, most of whose physical observables can be calculated by the conventional quantum many-body perturbation theory. We focus on the properties of the strange metal phase in the $t$-$J$ model.

However, the spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic metals has been less investigated and remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the spin Hall effect in representative ferromagnetic alloy by using first-principles calculations. We first clarify the spin Hall effect into three different types including conventional (CSHE), spin anomalous (SAHE) and magnetic spin Hall effect (MSHE) and then calculate the corresponding spin Hall conductivity and spin Hall angle for (Fe, Co, Ni)Pt, NiFe and CoFe alloy. We find the above three spin Hall mechanisms do coexist in ferromagnetic metals. Particularly, for Pt-based ferromagnetic alloy, a sizable conventional and magnetic spin Hall angles comparable to that of Pt have been predicted. The remarkable unconventional spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic metal may enrich the spin-charge conversion phenomena. For instance, the spin current generated by remarkable MSHE with out-of-plane spin-polarization should be helpful for field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization through spin-orbit torque effect. This work may stimulate future studies on the spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic metals and pave their promising applications for spin-charge conversion devices in spintronics. ",

These edge states are envisioned to serve as topologically protected information channels in low-loss magnonic devices. The standard description of TMI is based on linear spin-wave theory (LSWT), which approximates magnons as free non-interacting particles. However, magnon excitations of TMI are genuinely interacting even at zero temperature, calling into question descriptions based on LSWT alone. Here we perform a detailed non-linear spin-wave analysis to investigate the stability of chiral edge magnons. We identify three general breakdown mechanisms: (1) The edge magnon couples to itself, generating a finite lifetime that can be large enough to lead to a spectral annihilation of the chiral state; (2) The edge magnon hybridizes with the extended bulk magnons and, as a consequence, delocalizes away from the edge; (3) Due to a bulk-magnon mediated edge-to-edge coupling, the chiral magnons at opposite edges hybridize. We argue that, in general, these breakdown mechanisms may invalidate predictions based on LSWT and violate the notion of topological protection. We discuss strategies how the breakdown of chiral edge magnons can be avoided, e.g. via the application of large magnetic fields.

Our findings show that modifying either the transition metal or the chalcogen atoms significantly affects the free energy barriers (Delta F) and, consequently, the self-diffusion of hydrogen atoms between the 2DC layers. In the Hh polytype (2H stacking), MoSe2 exhibits the lowest Delta F, while WS2 has the highest, resulting in the largest D for the former system. Additionally, hydrogen atoms inside the RhM (or 3R) polytype encounter more than twice lower energy barriers and, thus, much higher diffusivity compared to those within the most stable Hh stacking. These findings are particularly significant when investigating twisted layers or homo- or heterostructures, as different stacking areas may dominate over others, potentially leading to directional transport and interesting materials for ion or atom sieving.

  "abstract": "We investigate the quantum transport of the heat and the charge through a quantum dot (QD) coupled to fermionic contacts under the influence of time modulation of temperatures. We derive within the nonequilibrium Keldysh Green's function (NEGF) formalism, exact formulas for the charge, heat currents and the dissipation power by employing the concept of gravitational field firstly introduced by Luttinger in the sixties. The gravitational field, entering into the system Hamiltonian and being coupled to the energies stored in the contacts, plays a similar role as the electrostatic potential that is coupled to the charge density. We extend the original idea of Luttinger to correctly handle the dynamical transport driven under a time-modulated (ac) temperature, by coupling the gravitational field to not only the contact energy but also to half of the energy stored in the tunneling barriers connecting the QD to the contacts. The validity of our formalism is supported in that it satisfies the Onsager reciprocity relations and also reproduces the dynamics obtained from the scattering theory for noninteracting cases. Our formalism provides a systematical procedure to obtain general expressions for the charge and heat currents in the linear response regime solely in terms of the retarded and advanced components of the interacting QD NEGFs by a help of the charge conservation and some sum rules. In order to demonstrate the utility of our formalism, we apply it to the noninteracting and interacting QD junctions and interpret the charge and heat transports in terms of the equivalent quantum RC circuits. Via a systematic consideration of the effect of the Coulomb interaction under the ac drive of temperature, our formalism reveals that the interaction can modify the response for charging and energy relaxation with a significant different temperature dependence.

It is well known that a free ellipsoidal Brownian particle exhibits anisotropic diffusion for short times which changes to isotropic at long times. We have further expanded this concept to incorporate active ellipsoidal particles characterized by an initial self-propelled velocity. In our previous study\\cite{ghosh2022persistence}, we derived the analytical expressions and simulation results of the persistence probability of an active anisotropic particle without any external potential and with an external harmonic potential. This paper provides analytical and simulation results of diffusion coefficients of an active ellipsoidal particle. In comparison to a passive particle, we demonstrate that the long-term diffusion coefficient of an active particle is influenced by both the magnitude of the propulsion velocity and the rotational diffusion coefficient. We have also studied the approximations of different results for diffusion coefficients in $t\\ll D_\\theta^{-1}$ time-scale. We investigated diffusion dynamics for the free particle as well as the particle in a harmonic trap, and the particle subject to a constant field force. Additionally, we have studied the scaled average velocity of an ellipsoidal active particle in different force fields.

We find shear thinning exponents in line with theoretical and experimental results and characterize the shape and orientation of bottlebrushes in steady-state flow. Many shape parameters derived from the gyration tensor show molecular alignment with the flow for all systems. Yet, the orientation of individual bonds is what most strongly correlates with the architecture-dependent shear-thinning exponents.

  "abstract": "Given a finite set of two-dimensional tile types, the field concerned with covering the plane with tiles of these types only has a long history, having enjoyed great prominence in the last six to seven decades, not only as a topic of recreational mathematics but mainly as a topic of scientific interest. Much of this interest has revolved around fundamental geometrical problems such as minimizing the variety of tile types to be used, and also around important applications in areas such as crystallography and others concerned with various atomic- and molecular-scale phenomena. All applications are of course confined to finite regions, but in many cases they refer back directly to progress in tiling the whole plane. Tilings of bounded regions of the plane have also been actively studied, but in general the additional complications imposed by the boundary conditions tend to constrain progress to mostly indirect results, such as recurrence relations. Here we study the tiling of rectangular regions of the plane by squares, dominoes, and straight tetraminoes. For this set of tile types, not even recurrence relations seem to be available. Our approach is to seek to characterize this system through some of the fundamental quantities of statistical physics. We do this on two parallel tracks, one fully analytical for a special case, the other based on the Wang-Landau method for state-density estimation. Given a simple Hamiltonian based solely on tile contacts, we have found either approach to lead to illuminating depictions of entropy, temperature, and above all phase separation. The notion of phase separation, in this context, refers to keeping track of how many tiles of each type are used in each of the many possibilities. We have found that this helps bind together different aspects of the system in question and conjecture that future applications will benefit from the possibilities it affords. ",

Cu deposition can be prevented during operation in air, irrespective of a critical voltage, if the thermal gradient is applied along the current direction.

  "abstract": "The presence of electron correlations in a system with topological order can lead to exotic ground states. Considering single crystals of LaAgSb2 which has a square net crystal structure, one finds multiple charge density wave transitions (CDW) as the temperature is lowered. We find large planar Hall (PHE) signals in the CDW phase, which are still finite in the high temperature phase though they change sign. Optimising the structure within first-principles calculations, one finds an unusual chiral metallic phase. This is because as the temperature is lowered, the separation between the Ag/Sb atoms on different layers decreases, leading to stronger repulsions between electrons associated with atoms on different layers. This leads to successive layers sliding with respect to each other, thereby stabilising a chiral structure in which inversion symmetry is also broken. The large Berry curvature associated with the low-temperature structure explains the low temperature PHE. At high temperature, the PHE arises from the changes induced in the anisotropic Dirac cone in presence a magnetic field. Our work represents a route towards detecting and understanding the mechanism in a correlation driven topological transition through electron transport measurements, complemented by ab-initio electronic structure calculations.

Solids in the form of boats composed of centimeter-scale sugar and salt slabs attached to a buoy are observed to move rapidly in water with speeds up to 5 mm/s determined by the inclination angle and orientation of the dissolving surfaces. While symmetric boats drift slowly, asymmetric boats are observed to accelerate rapidly along a line before reaching a terminal velocity when their drag matches the thrust generated by dissolution. By visualizing the flow around the body, we show that the boat velocity is always directed opposite to the horizontal component of the density current. We derive the thrust acting on the body from its measured kinematics, and show that the propulsion mechanism is consistent with the unbalanced momentum generated by the attached density current. We obtain an analytical formula for the body speed depending on geometry and material properties, and show that it captures the observed trends reasonably. Our analysis shows that the gravity current sets the scale of the body speed consistent with our observations, and we estimate that speeds can grow slowly as the cube-root of the length of the inclined dissolving surface. The dynamics of dissolving solids demonstrated here applies equally well to solids undergoing phase change, and may enhance the drift of melting icebergs, besides unraveling a primal strategy by which to achieve locomotion in active matter.

Due to the coupling of superconductivity and magnetism in this system, the magnetic moment precession of the ferromagnetic layer caused by the magnetic component of external radiation can lock the Josephson oscillations, which results in the appearance of the particular type of steps in the current-voltage characteristics, completely different from the well known Shapiro steps. We call these steps the Buzdin steps in the case when the system is driven only by the magnetic component and the chimera steps in the case when both magnetic and electric components are present. Unlike the Shapiro steps where the magnetization remains constant along the step, here it is changing though the system is locked. The spin-orbit coupling substantially contributes to the amplitude, i.e., the size of these steps. Dramatic changes in their amplitudes are also observed at frequencies near the ferromagnetic resonance. Combinations of the Josephson and Kittel ferromagnetic resonances together with different types of locking pronounced in dynamics and current-voltage characteristics make the physics of this system very interesting and open up a series of novel applications.

  "abstract": "Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is one of the most ubiquitous characterization techniques utilized in the field of condensed matter physics. The resulting spectral intensity consists of a coherent and incoherent part, whose relative contribution is governed by atomic disorder, where thermal contribution is expressed in terms of the Debye-Waller factor (DWF). In this work, we present a soft-X-ray study on the sputter-induced disorder of InAs(110) surface. We define a new quantity, referred to as the coherence factor FC, which is the analogue of the DWF, extended to static disorder. We show that FC alone can be used to quantify the depletion of coherent intensity with increasing disorder, and, in combination with the DWF, allows considerations of thermal and static disorder effects on the same footing. Our study also unveils an intriguing finding: as disorder increases, the ARPES intensity of quantum well states originating from the conduction band depletes more rapidly compared to the valence bands. This difference can be attributed to the predominance of quasi-elastic defect scattering and the difference in phase space available for such scattering for conduction-band (CB) and valence-band (VB) initial states. Specifically, the absence of empty states well below the Fermi energy (EF) hinders the quasi-elastic scattering of the VB states, while their abundance in vicinity of EF enhances the scattering rate of the CB states. Additionally, we observe no noticeable increase in broadening of the VB dispersions as the sputter-induced disorder increases. This observation aligns with the notion that valence initial states are less likely to experience the quasi-elastic defect scattering, which would shorten their lifetime, and with the random uncorrelated nature of the defects introduced by the ion sputtering.

  "abstract": "Periodic spatial modulations of the superfluid density, or pair density waves, have now been widely detected in unconventional superconductors, either as the primary or the secondary states accompanying charge density waves. Understanding how these density waves emerge, or conversely get suppressed by external parameters, provides an important insight into their nature. Here we use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study the evolution of density waves in the heavy fermion spin-triplet superconductor UTe2 as a function of temperature and magnetic field. We discover that charge modulations, composed of three different wave vectors gradually weaken but persist to a surprisingly high temperature T_CDW ~ 10-12 K. By tracking the local amplitude of modulations, we find that these modulations become spatially inhomogeneous, and form patches that shrink in size with higher temperature or with applied magnetic field. Interestingly, one of the density wave vectors along the mirror symmetry has a slightly different temperature onset, thus revealing an unexpected decoupling of the three-component CDW state. Importantly, T_CDW determined from our work matches closely to the temperature scale believed to be related to magnetic fluctuations, providing the first possible connection between density waves observed by surface probes and bulk measurements. Combined with magnetic field sensitivity of the modulations, this could point towards an important role of spin fluctuations or short-range magnetic order in the formation of the primary charge density wave.

The central body can mimic a black hole at the center of a galaxy or a rocky core (protoplanet) in the context of planetary formation. In the chemotaxis of bacterial populations, sharing formal analogies with self-gravitating systems, the central body can be a supply of ``food'' (chemoattractant). We consider both microcanonical (fixed energy) and canonical (fixed temperature) descriptions and study the inequivalence of statistical ensembles. At high energies (resp. high temperatures), the system is in a ``gaseous'' phase and at low energies (resp. low temperatures) it is in a condensed phase with a ``cusp-halo'' structure, where the cusp corresponds to the rapid increase of the density of the gas at the contact with the central body. For a fixed density $\\rho_{*}$ of the central body, we show the existence of two critical points in the phase diagram, one in each ensemble, depending on the core radius $R_{*}$: for small radii $R_{*}<R_{*}^{\\rm MCP}$, there exist both microcanonical and canonical phase transitions (that are zeroth and first order); for intermediate radii $R_{*}^{\\rm MCP}<R_{*}<R_{*}^{\\rm CCP}$, only canonical phase transitions are present; and for large radii $R_{*}>R_{*}^{\\rm CCP}$, there is no phase transition at all.

So far, experiments probing the interplay between topology and inter-particle interactions have remained relatively scarce. Here we observe a Thouless-type charge pump in which the particle current and its directionality inherently rely on the presence of strong interactions. Experimentally, we utilise fermionic atoms in a dynamical superlattice which traces a pump trajectory that remains trivial in the non-interacting limit. Remarkably, the transferred charge in the interacting system is half of its usual value in the non-interacting case, in agreement with matrix-product-state simulations. Our experiments suggest that Thouless charge pumps are promising platforms to gain insights into interaction-driven topological transitions and topological quantum matter. ",

Another fundamental question is whether such a macroscopic description exists at all and how well it describes the large-scale properties. Here, we address these questions using as a canonical example of a self-organizing complex system - the collective motion of desert locusts. One of the world's most devastating insect plagues begins when flightless juvenile locusts form \"marching bands\". Moving through semiarid habitats in the search for food, these bands display remarkable coordinated motion. We investigated how well physical models can describe the flow of locusts within a band. For this, we filmed locusts within marching bands during an outbreak in Kenya and automatically tracked all individuals passing through the camera frame. We first analysed the spatial topology of nearest neighbors and found individuals to be isotropically distributed. Despite this apparent randomness, a local order was observed in regions of high density with a clear second neighbor peak in the radial distribution function, akin to an ordered fluid. Furthermore, reconstructing individual locust trajectories revealed a highly-aligned movement, consistent with the one-dimensional version of the Toner-Tu equations, which are a generalization of the Navier-Stokes equations for fluids, used to describe the equivalent macroscopic fluid properties of active particles. Using this effective Toner-Tu equation, which relates the gradient of the pressure to the acceleration, we show that the effective \"pressure\" of locusts increases as a linear function of density in segments with highest polarization. Our study thus demonstrates an effective hydrodynamic description of flow dynamics in plague locust swarms. ",

The difference in technical realizations of those models could be conceived as minor details, but we discover significantly notable changes caused by the possibly inadvertent modification. For the Harary model, the stochasticity in the original formulation allows a much wider range of the clustering coefficient and the average shortest path length. For the Newman-Watts model, due to the drastically different degree distributions, the clustering coefficient can also be affected, which is verified by our higher-order analytic derivation. During the process, we discover the equivalence of the Newman-Watts (better known in the network science or physics community) and the Harary (better known in the graph theory or mathematics community) models under a specific condition of restricted parity in variables, which would bridge the two relatively independently developed models in different fields.

Method: The Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations with a Skyrme $+$ local-pair energy-density functional (EDF) are performed to investigate the pairing condensate in the spherical ground states of Ca and Sn isotopes. Results: The spin-singlet pair EDF induces not only the spin-singlet but also the spin-triplet pairing condensates due to a strong spin-orbit splitting. By discarding the spin-orbit EDF, only the spin-singlet pairing condensate appears. The spin-triplet pair EDF, however, induces the spin-orbit splitting and accordingly the spin-singlet pairing condensate.

  "abstract": "Kinetic theory has long predicted that temperature inversion may happen in the vapor-phase for evaporation and condensation between two parallel plates, i.e., the vapor temperature at the condensation interface is higher than that at the evaporation interface. However, past studies have neglected transport in the liquid phases, which usually determine the evaporation and condensation rates. This disconnect has limited the acceptance of the kinetic theory in practical heat transfer models. In this paper, we combine interfacial conditions for mass and heat fluxes with continuum descriptions in the bulk regions of the vapor and the liquid phases to obtain a complete picture for the classical problem of evaporation and condensation between two parallel plates. The criterion for temperature inversion is rederived analytically. We also prove that the temperature jump at each interface is in the same direction as externally applied temperature difference, i.e., liquid surface is at a higher temperature than its adjacent vapor on the evaporating interface and at a lower temperature than its adjacent vapor on the condensing interface. We explain the interfacial temperature jump and temperature inversion using the interfacial cooling and heating processes, and we predict that this process can lead to a vapor phase temperature much lower than the lowest wall temperatures and much higher than the highest wall temperature imposed. When the latent heat of evaporation is small, we found that evaporation can happen at the low temperature side while condensation occur at the high temperature side, opposing the temperature gradient.

The results show that near the graphene neutrality point, the surface wave has a linear dispersion with a universal speed close to $v_{\\mathrm{F}}/\\sqrt{2}$.

  "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of bound state formation is one of the fundamental questions in confining quantum field theories such as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). One hadronization mechanism that has garnered significant attention is the breaking of a string initially connecting a fermion and an anti-fermion. Deepening our understanding of real-time string-breaking dynamics with simpler, lower dimensional models like the Schwinger model can improve our understanding of the hadronization process in QCD and other confining systems found in condensed matter and statistical systems. In this paper, we consider the string-breaking dynamics within the Schwinger model and investigate its modification inside a thermal medium, treating the Schwinger model as an open quantum system coupled to a thermal environment. Within the regime of weak coupling between the system and environment, the real-time evolution of the system can be described by a Lindblad evolution equation. We analyze the Liouvillian gaps of this Lindblad equation and the time dependence of the system's von Neumann entropy. We observe that the late-time relaxation rate decreases as the environment correlation length increases. Moreover, when the environment correlation length is infinite, the system exhibits two steady states, one in each of the sectors with definite charge-conjugation-parity (CP) quantum numbers. For parameter regimes where an initial string breaks in vacuum, we observe a delay of the string breaking in the medium, due to kinetic dissipation effects. Conversely, in regimes where an initial string remains intact in vacuum time evolution, we observe string breaking (melting) in the thermal medium. We further discuss how the Liouvillian dynamics of the open Schwinger model can be simulated on quantum computers and provide an estimate of the associated Trotter errors. ",

We mitigate feedback-delay error by introducing a forward-state-estimation strategy in the feedback controller that tracks the effects of control signals already in transit. ",

Quantum nearest-neighbour clustering promises a speed-up over the classical algorithms, but the current embedding of classical data introduces inaccuracies, insurmountable slowdowns, or undesired effects. This work proposes the generalised inverse stereographic projection into the Bloch sphere as an encoding for quantum distance estimation in k nearest-neighbour clustering, develops an analogous classical counterpart, and benchmarks its accuracy, runtime and convergence. Our proposed algorithm provides an improvement in both the accuracy and the convergence rate of the algorithm. We detail an experimental optic fibre setup as well, from which we collect 64-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation data. This is the dataset upon which the algorithms are benchmarked. Through experiments, we demonstrate the numerous benefits and practicality of using the `quantum-inspired' stereographic k nearest-neighbour for clustering real-world optical-fibre data. This work also proves that one can achieve a greater advantage by optimising the radius of the inverse stereographic projection. ",

Secondly, when a fixed disturbance occurs, how informative is the possible measurement in the best-case scenario?

In particular, we show there are different trade-off relations between the sharpness of this measurement and the average fidelity of the pre-measurement and post-measurement state spaces as well as the sharpness and quantum resources preserved in the post-measurement states in terms of coherence and discord-like correlation once the measurement is applied locally.

Hidden tensor structures imply that any quantum system, even as simple as a single one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, can be decomposed into an arbitrary number of subsystems. The resulting structure is rich enough to enable quantum computation, violation of Bell's inequalities, and formulation of universal quantum gates. In principle, a single-particle quantum computer is possible. Moreover, it is shown that these hidden structures are at the roots of some well known theoretical constructions, such as the Brandt-Greenberg multi-boson representation of creation-annihilation operators, intensively investigated in the context of higher-order or fractional-order squeezing.

  "abstract": "Strong dissipation of plasmonic resonances is detrimental to quantum manipulation. To enhance the quantum coherence, we propose to tailor the local density of states (LDOS) of plasmonic resonances by integrating with a photonic cavity operating at a chiral exceptional point (CEP), where the phase of light field can offer a new degree of freedom to flexibly manipulate the quantum states. A quantized few-mode theory is employed to reveal that the LDOS of the proposed hybrid cavity can evolve into sub-Lorentzian lineshape, with order-of-magnitude linewidth narrowing and additionally a maximum of eightfold enhancement compared to the usual plasmonic-photonic cavity without CEP. This results in the enhanced coherent light-matter interaction accompanied by the reduced dissipation of polaritonic states. Furthermore, a scattering theory based on eigenmode decomposition is present to elucidate two mechanisms responsible for the significant improvement of quantum yield at CEP, the reduction of plasmonic absorption by the Fano interference and the enhancement of cavity radiation through the superscattering. Importantly, we find the latter allows achieving a near-unity quantum yield at room temperature; in return, high quantum yield is beneficial to experimentally verify the enhanced LDOS at CEP by measuring the fluorescence lifetime of a quantum emitter. Therefore, our work demonstrates that the plasmonic resonances in CEP-engineered environment can serve as a promising platform for exploring the quantum states control by virtue of the non-Hermiticity of open optical resonators and building the high-performance quantum devices for sensing, spectroscopy, quantum information processing and quantum computing.

Here, we propose a prototypical arrangement to implement a whispering-gallery-mode resonator with topological mirror moulded by one-dimensional atom array, which allows to boost the lifetime of cavity polaritons over an order of magnitude. This considerable enhancement attributes to the coupling of polaritonic states to dissipationless edge states protected by the topological bandgap of atom array that suppresses the leakage of cavity modes. When exceeding the width of Rabi splitting, topological bandgap can further reduce the dissipation from polaritonic states to bulk states of atom array, giving arise to subradiant cavity polaritons with extremely sharp linewidth. The resultant Rabi oscillation decays with a rate even below the free-space decay of a single quantum emitter. Inheriting from the topologically protected properties of edge states, the subradiance of cavity polaritons can be preserved in the disordered atom mirror with moderate perturbations involving the atomic frequency, interaction strengths and location.

In the presence of repulsive Hubbard interaction, the antiferromagnetic phase is enhanced, but the phase transition remains first-order. Here we explore the physics of the SSH model with attractive Hubbard interaction, which hosts an interesting interplay among charge order, s-wave pairing, and bond order. Using the numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we show that both charge order, present at weak electron-phonon coupling, and bond order, at large coupling, give way to s-wave pairing when the system is doped. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the SSH electron-phonon interaction competes with the attractive Hubbard interaction and reduces the s-wave pairing correlation. ",

Most of the existing studies were devoted to the monolayer Hubbard model, which is the simplest model that captures essential features of high-temperature superconductivity. Here we discover a new type of non-Fermi liquid behavior emergent in the hole-doped bilayer Hubbard model, using dynamical mean-field theory with a full consideration of the short-range interlayer electron correlation. We find that at low temperatures, the Hall coefficient has a strong nonmonotonic dependence on temperature, leading to a double or quadruple reversal of its sign depending on the doping level. At the same time, the resistivity exhibits two plateaus rather than linearity in its temperature dependence. We show that these intriguing transport behaviors stem from the formation of coherent interlayer singlets, which scatter off gapped collective modes arising from short-range interlayer antiferromagnetic fluctuations.

  "abstract": "The present work is concerned with studying accurately the energy-loss processes that control the thermalization of hot electrons and holes that are generated by high-energy radiation in wurtzite GaN, using an ab initio approach. Current physical models of the nuclear/particle physics community cover thermalization in the high-energy range (kinetic energies exceeding ~100 eV), and the electronic-device community has studied extensively carrier transport in the low-energy range (below ~10 eV). However, the processes that control the energy losses and thermalization of electrons and holes in the intermediate energy range of about 10-100 eV (the \"10-100 eV gap\") are poorly known. The aim of this research is to close this gap, by utilizing density functional theory (DFT) to obtain the band structure and dielectric function of GaN for energies up to about 100 eV. We also calculate charge-carrier scattering rates for the major charge-carrier interactions (phonon scattering, impact ionization, and plasmon emission), using the DFT results and first-order perturbation theory. With this information, we study the thermalization of electrons starting at 100 eV using the Monte Carlo method to solve the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation. Full thermalization of electrons and holes is complete within ~1 and 0.5 ps, respectively. Hot electrons dissipate about 90% of their initial kinetic energy to the electron-hole gas (90 eV) during the first ~0.1 fs, due to rapid plasmon emission and impact ionization at high energies. The remaining energy is lost more slowly as phonon emission dominates at lower energies (below ~10 eV). During the thermalization, hot electrons generate pairs with an average energy of ~8.9 eV/pair (11-12 pairs per hot electron). Additionally, during the thermalization, the maximum electron displacement from its original position is found to be on the order of 100 nm. ",

In particular the charge distribution induced by a Coulomb impurity exhibits a power law tail modulated by a strain-dependent admixture of angular harmonics. The appearance of distributed charge is in sharp contrast to the response in pristine/isotropic graphene, where for subcritical impurities the polarization charge is fully localized at the impurity position. It is also interesting to note that our results are obtained strictly at zero chemical potential, and the behavior is fundamentally distinct from the typical Friedel oscillations observed at finite chemical potential. For weak to moderate strain, the $d$-wave symmetry is dominant. The presence of Dirac cone tilt, relevant to some 2D materials beyond graphene, can also substantially affect the induced charge distribution.

Homogeneous melting at the superheating critical limit($T_h$), is accompanied by a temperature drop to the equilibrium melting temperature($T_m$). Implementation of the Z method interfaced with modern {\\it ab initio} electronic structure packages use Hellman-Faynman dynamics to propagate the ions in the NVE ensemble with the Mermin free energy plus the ionic kinetic energy conserved. So the electronic temperature($T_{el}$) is kept fixed along the trajectory which may introduce some spurious ion-electron interactions in MD runs with large temperature changes. We estimate possible systematic errors in evaluating melting temperature with different choices of $T_{el}$. MD runs with the $T_{el}$ = $T_h$ and $T_{el}$ = $T_m$ shows that the difference in melting temperature can be 200-300 K (3-5\\% of the melting temperature) for our two test systems. Our results are in good agreement with previous studies with different methods, suggesting the CaSiO$_3$ and SiO$_2$ melts at around 6500 at 100 GPa and 6000 K at 160 GPa. The melting temperature decreases with increasing $T_{el}$ due to the increasing entropic stabilisation of the liquid and the system melts about 3 times faster with $T_{el} = T_h$ than with $T_{el} = T_m$. A careful choice of $T_{el}$ in BOMD is essential for the critical evaluation of the Z method especially at very high temperatures. Inspection of the homogeneous melting process shows that melting occurs via a two-step mechanism: 1) melting of the anion sublattice is accompanied by a small drop in temperature and 2) the formation of small defects which trigger the formation of small liquid clusters and fully melted.

While initial experiments suggested that the CDW phase breaks time-reversal symmetry, this idea is being intensely debated due to conflicting experimental data. In this work we use laser-coupled scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to study RbV$_3$Sb$_5$.

A similar experiment was repeated for Ferrocene terminated with amine (-NH2) and cyano (-CN) anchors, where conductance histograms exhibit an extended low conductance feature including the sharp high conductance peak, similar to pristine ferrocene. Statistical analysis of the data along with density functional theory-based transport calculation suggests the possible molecular conformation with a strong hybridization between the Au electrodes and Fe atom of Ferrocene molecule is responsible for a near-perfect transmission in the vicinity of the Fermi energy, leading to the resonant transport at a small applied bias (< 0.5V). Moreover, calculations including Van der Waals/dispersion corrections reveal a covalent like organometallic bonding between Au and the central Fe atom of Ferrocene, having bond energies of ~ 660 meV. Overall, our study not only demonstrates the realization of an air-stable highly transmitting molecular junction, but also provides an important insight about the nature of chemical bonding at the metal/organo-metallic interface.

  "abstract": "Using Brownian vibrators, we conducted a study on the structures and dynamics of quasi-2d granular materials with packing fractions ($\\phi$) ranging from 0.111 to 0.832. Our observations revealed a remarkable large-scale collective motion in hard granular disk systems, encompassing four distinct phases: granular fluid, collective fluid, poly-crystal, and crystal. The collective motion emerge at $\\phi=$0.317, coinciding with a peak in local density fluctuations. However, this collective motion ceased to exist at $\\phi=$0.713 when the system transitioned into a crystalline state. While the poly-crystal and crystal phases exhibited similarities to equilibrium hard disks, the first two phases differed significantly from the equilibrium systems and previous experiments involving uniformly driven spheres. This disparity suggests that the collective motion arises from a competition controlled by volume fraction. Specifically, it involves an active force and an effective attractive interaction resulting from inelastic particle collisions. Remarkably, these findings align with recent theoretical research on the flocking motion of spherical active particles without alignment mechanisms. ",

  "abstract": "Nonlocal spin polarization phenomena are thoroughly investigated in the devices made of chiral metallic single crystals of CrNb$_3$S$_6$ and NbSi$_2$ as well as of polycrystalline NbSi$_2$. We demonstrate that simultaneous injection of charge currents in the opposite ends of the device with the nonlocal setup induces the switching behavior of spin polarization in a controllable manner. Such a nonlocal spin polarization appears regardless of the difference in the materials and device dimensions, implying that the current injection in the nonlocal configuration splits spin-dependent chemical potentials throughout the chiral crystal even though the current is injected into only a part of the crystal. We show that the proposed model of the spin dependent chemical potentials explains the experimental data successfully. The nonlocal double-injection device may offer significant potential to control the spin polarization to large areas because of the nature of long-range nonlocal spin polarization in chiral materials.

  "abstract": "Percolation has two mean-field theories, the Gaussian fixed point (GFP) and the Landau mean-field theory or the complete graph (CG) asymptotics. By large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we systematically study the interplay of the GFP and CG effects to the finite-size scaling of percolation above the upper critical dimension $d_c = 6$ with periodic, free, and cylindrical boundary conditions. Our results suggest that, with periodic boundaries, the \\emph{unwrapped} correlation length scales as $L^{d/6}$ at the critical point, diverging faster than $L$ above $d_c$. As a consequence, the scaling behaviours of macroscopic quantities with respect to the linear system size $L$ follow the CG asymptotics. The distance-dependent properties, such as the short-distance behaviour of the two-point correlation function and the Fourier transformed quantities with non-zero modes, are still controlled by the GFP. With free boundaries, since the correlation length is cutoff by $L$, the finite-size scaling at the critical point is controlled by the GFP. However, some quantities are observed to exhibit the CG aysmptotics at the low-temperature pseudo-critical point, such as the sizes of the two largest clusters. With cylindrical boundaries, due to the interplay of the GFP and CG effects, the correlation length along the axial direction of the cylinder scales as $\\xi_L \\sim L^{(d-1)/5}$ within the critical window of size $O(L^{-2(d-1)/5})$, distinct from both periodic and free boundaries. A field-theoretical calculation for deriving the scaling of $\\xi_L$ is also presented. Moreover, the one-point surface correlation function along the axial direction of the cylinder is observed to scale as ${\\tau}^{(1-d)/2}$ for short distance but then enter a plateau of order $L^{-3(d-1)/5}$ before it decays significantly fast.

However, the underlying differences between these two fascinating materials have remained elusive. Here we uncover distinct elastic properties concerning observation and aging times in glasses and gels, while delving into the underlying mechanisms. In glasses, we observe a gradual decrease in the shear modulus, while the bulk modulus remains constant throughout the observation time. In contrast, gels exhibit a decrease in both the shear and bulk moduli over the observation time. Additionally, during aging, glasses exhibit a steady trend of stiffening, while gels demonstrate initial stiffening followed by softening. By unravelling the intricate relationship between structure, dynamics, and elasticity, we attribute these differences to mechanisms that minimize free energy: structural ordering in glasses and interface reduction in gels. Our work not only uncovers the distinct behaviors of glasses and gels but also sheds light on the origin and evolution of elasticity in non-equilibrium disordered solids, offering significant implications for the application and design of amorphous materials.

Unexpectedly strong electron-phonon interactions, however, are needed to explain near-unity up-conversion efficiencies wherein multiple-phonon absorption rates become competitive with multiple-phonon-emission mediated non-radiative relaxation.

Superconducting material enables the magnets to carry current densities that would melt materials with non-zero resistance. Quench occurs when superconductivity is lost and the current starts to generate heat. Unless prevented with a fast enough control system, the heat generated during a quench can cause catastrophic damage to the coils. This work describes a less-studied heating mechanism that increases the likelihood and aggressiveness of fusion magnet quenches. Defects accumulate in the magnet structural material under irradiation by the fusion process. The defects store energy in the material and change thermal and normal state electrical properties. Wigner energy is released when defects anneal. After a 0.9 mDPA neutron irradiation, a 10 K disturbance from 20 K is predicted to release enough energy to result in a final temperature of 40 K. Irradiation damage also reduces the quench time constant by increasing normal state resistivity and thus Ohmic heating. The continuous operation of a fusion reactor produces an increasingly unstable thermodynamic system in superconducting magnets by changing electrical and thermal properties with irradiation damage. The temperature margin between operation and quench runaway reduces with irradiation. The next steps are to include these observations in quench models and validate the predictions experimentally. Implications of this work is felt by all fusion powerplant projects planning to leverage superconducting magnets. Designs will recognize this risk with more stringent specifications on quench control systems and maximum duration of coil operation at cryogenic temperature between periodic releases of Wigner energy to avoid catastrophic quench failures.

These ensembles take on the same role as the ensembles of random Hamiltonians in more conventional quantum ergodic phases of many-body quantum systems. To describe individual members of the ensembles, we introduce the notion of approximate CFT, defined as a collection of `CFT data' satisfying the usual CFT constraints approximately, i.e. up to small deviations.

Ensembles of approximate CFTs are very natural in holography, as every member of the ensemble is indistinguishable from a true CFT for low-energy probes that only have access to information from semi-classical gravity. To specify these ensembles, we impose successively higher moments of the CFT constraints. Lastly, we propose a theory of pure gravity in AdS$_3$ as a random matrix/tensor model implementing approximate CFT constraints. This tensor model is the maximum ignorance ensemble compatible with conformal symmetry, crossing invariance, and a primary gap to the black-hole threshold.

  "abstract": "The paper analyzes the entropy of a system composed by an arbitrary number of indistinguishable particles at the equilibrium, defining entropy as a function of the quantum state of the system, not of its phase space representation. Our crucial observation is that the entropy of the system is the Shannon entropy of the random occupancy numbers of the quantum states allowed to system's particles. We consider the information-theoretic approach, which is based on Jaynes' maximum entropy principle, and the empirical approach, which leads to canonical typicality in modern quantum thermodynamics. In the information-theoretic approach, the occupancy numbers of particles' quantum states are multinomially distributed, while in the empirical approach their distribution is multivariate hypergeometric. As the number of samples of the empirical probability tends to infinity, the multivariate hypergeometric distribution tends to the multinomial distribution. This reconciles, at least in the limit, the two approaches. When regarded from the perspective of quantum measurement, our analysis suggests the existence of another kind of subjectivism than the well-known subjectivism that characterizes the maximum entropy approach. This form of subjectivity is responsible for the collapse of entropy to zero after the quantum measurement, both in the information-theoretic and in the empirical approaches. ",

  "abstract": "The vacuum of the lattice Schwinger model is prepared on up to 100 qubits of IBM's Eagle-processor quantum computers. A new algorithm to prepare the ground state of a gapped translationally-invariant system on a quantum computer is presented, which we call Scalable Circuits ADAPT-VQE (SC-ADAPT-VQE). This algorithm uses the exponential decay of correlations between distant regions of the ground state, together with ADAPT-VQE, to construct quantum circuits for state preparation that can be scaled to arbitrarily large systems. SC-ADAPT-VQE is applied to the Schwinger model, and shown to be systematically improvable, with an accuracy that converges exponentially with circuit depth. Both the structure of the circuits and the deviations of prepared wavefunctions are found to become independent of the number of spatial sites, $L$. This allows for a controlled extrapolation of the circuits, determined using small or modest-sized systems, to arbitrarily large $L$. The circuits for the Schwinger model are determined on lattices up to $L=14$ (28 qubits) with the qiskit classical simulator, and subsequently scaled up to prepare the $L=50$ (100 qubits) vacuum on IBM's 127 superconducting-qubit quantum computers ibm_brisbane and ibm_cusco. After applying an improved error-mitigation technique, which we call Operator Decoherence Renormalization, the chiral condensate and charge-charge correlators obtained from the quantum computers are found to be in good agreement with classical Matrix Product State simulations.

We demonstrate high-efficiency single photon emission from a single T center using a nanobeam. The nanobeam efficiently radiates light in a mode that is well-matched to a lensed fiber, enabling us to collect over 70% of the T center emission directly into a single mode fiber.

  "abstract": "Finding optimal pathways in chemical reaction networks is essential for elucidating and designing chemical processes, with significant applications such as synthesis planning and metabolic pathway analysis. Such a chemical pathway-finding problem can be formulated as a constrained combinatorial optimization problem, aiming to find an optimal combination of chemical reactions connecting starting materials to target materials in a given network. Due to combinatorial explosion, the computation time required to find an optimal pathway increases exponentially with the network size. Ising machines, including quantum and simulated annealing devices, are promising novel computers dedicated to such hard combinatorial optimization. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has yet to be an attempt to apply Ising machines to chemical pathway-finding problems. In this article, we present the first Ising/quantum computing application for chemical pathway-finding problems. The Ising model, translated from a chemical pathway-finding problem, involves several types of penalty terms for violating constraints. It is not obvious how to set appropriate penalty strengths of different types. To address this challenge, we employ Bayesian optimization for parameter tuning. Furthermore, we introduce a novel technique that enhances tuning performance by grouping penalty terms according to the underlying problem structure. The performance evaluation and analysis of the proposed algorithm were conducted using a D-Wave Advantage system and simulated annealing. The benchmark results reveal challenges in finding exact optimal pathways. Concurrently, the results indicate the feasibility of finding approximate optimal pathways, provided that a certain degree of relative error in cost value is acceptable. ",

The types of eigenstates are identified by means of the phase space overlap index, which is defined as the overlap of the Husimi function with regular and chaotic regions in classical phase space. We show that the mixed eigenstates appear due to various tunneling precesses between different phase space structures, while the regular and chaotic eigenstates are, respectively, associated with invariant tori and chaotic component in phase space. We examine how the probability distribution of the phase space overlap index evolves with increasing system size for different kicking strengths. In particular, we find that the relative fraction of mixed states exhibits a power-law decay as the system size increases, indicating that only purely regular and chaotic eigenstates are left in the strict semiclassical limit.

First, we study Shor's original factoring algorithm. While theoretical bounds suggest success probabilities of only 3-4 %, we find average success probabilities above 50 %, due to a high frequency of \"lucky\" cases, defined as successful factorizations despite unmet sufficient conditions. Second, we investigate a powerful post-processing procedure, by which the success probability can be brought arbitrarily close to one, with only a single run of Shor's quantum algorithm.

In particular, we derive that the regions of the Strong Mpemba effect in cooling and heating are non-overlapping and that there is, at most, a single Strong Mpemba temperature. Next, we illustrate our results on a Maxwell demon setup, where we show that one can utilize the strong variant of the Mpemba effect to have shorter cycles of the Maxwell demon device, leading to increased power output, and stable device operation, without sacrificing efficiency.

  "abstract": "Attaining high reversibility of electrodes and electrolyte is essential for the longevity of secondary batteries. Rechargeable zinc-air batteries (RZABs), however, encounter drastic irreversible changes in the zinc anodes and air cathodes during cycling. To uncover the mechanisms of reversibility loss in RZABs, we investigate the evolution of zinc anode, alkaline electrolyte, and air electrode through experiments and first-principles calculations. Morphology diagrams of zinc anodes under versatile operating conditions reveal that the nano-sized mossy zinc dominates the later cycling stage. Such anodic change is induced by the increased zincate concentration due to hydrogen evolution, which is catalyzed by the mossy structure and results in oxide passivation on electrodes, and eventually leads to low true Coulombic efficiencies and short lifespans of batteries. Inspired by these findings, we finally present a novel overcharge-cycling protocol to compensate the Coulombic efficiency loss caused by hydrogen evolution and significantly extend the battery life.

Two stable charged domain wall configurations exhibit topological interfacial states near their domain walls, which is caused by the change of the Z_2 number between ferroelectric and paraelectric states.

While it may proceed through the binding of perfectly matched, puzzle-pieces-like particles, many other instances involve ill-fitting particles that must deform to fit together. These include some pathological proteins, which have a known propensity to form fibrous aggregates. Despite this observation, the general relationship between the individual characteristics of the particles and the overall structure of the aggregate is not understood. To elucidate it, we analytically and numerically study the self-assembly of two-dimensional, deformable ill-fitting particles. We find that moderately sticky particles tend to form equilibrium self-limited aggregates whose size is set by an elastic boundary layer associated with collective deformations that may extend over many particles. Particles with a soft internal deformation mode thus give rise to large aggregates. Besides, when the particles are incompressible, their aggregates tend to be anisotropic and fiber-like. Our results are preserved in a more complex particle model with randomly chosen elastic properties. This indicates that generic protein characteristics such as allostery and incompressibility could favor the formation of fibers in protein aggregation, and suggests design principles for artificial self-assembling structures.

The energy and power densities of Na superionic conductor (NaSICON) electrode materials are promising for large-scale energy storage applications. However, several practical issues limit the full utilization of the theoretical energy densities of NaSICON electrodes. A pressing challenge lies in the limited sodium extraction in low Na content NaSICONs, e.g., $\\rm Na_1V^{IV}V^{IV}(PO_4)_3 \\leftrightarrow V^{V}V^{IV}(PO_4)_3 + 1e^- + 1Na^+$.

Using a kinetic Monte Carlo approach bearing the accuracy of first-principles calculations, we elucidate the variability of Na-ion transport vs. Na content in three important NaSICON electrodes, Na$_{\\rm x}$Ti$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$, Na$_{\\rm x}$V$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$, and Na$_{\\rm x}$Cr$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$.

The competition with the ordering-disordering phenomena of Na-vacancies also plays a role in influencing Na-transport. We link the variations in the Na$^+$ kinetic properties by analyzing the competition of ligand field stabilization transition metal ions and their ionic radii. We interpret the limited Na-extraction at $x = 1$ observed experimentally by gaining insights into the local Na-vacancy interplay.

  "abstract": "In 1987, Liechtenstein et al. came up with the idea to formulate the problem of interatomic exchange interactions, which would describe the energy change caused by the infinitesimal rotations of spins, in terms of the magnetic susceptibility. The formulation appears to be very generic and, for isotropic systems, expresses the energy change in the form of the Heisenberg model, irrespectively on which microscopic mechanism stands behind the interaction parameters. Moreover, this approach establishes the relationship between the exchange interactions and the electronic structure obtained, for instance, in the first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory. The purpose of this review is to elaborate basic ideas of the linear response theories for the exchange interactions as well as more resent developments. The special attention is paid to the approximations underlying the original method of Liechtenstein et al. in comparison with its more recent and more rigorous extensions, the roles of the on-site Coulomb interactions and the ligand states, and calculations of antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, which can be performed alongside with the isotropic exchange, within one computational scheme.

The similar energy scales between spin, lattice, and electronic degrees of freedom in these systems give rise to competing quantum phases such as charge density wave (CDW), magnetic order, and superconductivity. For example, kagome metal FeGe first exhibits A-type collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at T_N ~ 400 K, then establishes a CDW phase coupled with AFM ordered moment below T_CDW ~ 100 K, and finally forms a $c$-axis double cone AFM structure around T_Canting ~ 60 K. Here we use neutron scattering to demonstrate the presence of gapless incommensurate spin excitations associated with the double cone AFM structure at temperatures well above T_Canting and T_CDW that merge into gapped commensurate spin waves from the A-type AFM order. While commensurate spin waves follow the Bose population factor and can be well described by a local moment Heisenberg Hamiltonian, the incommensurate spin excitations first appear below T_N where AFM order is commensurate, start to deviate from the Bose population factor around T_CDW, and peaks at T_Canting, consistent with a critical scattering of a second order magnetic phase transition, as a function of decreasing temperature. By comparing these results with density functional theory calculations, we conclude that the incommensurate magnetic structure arises from the nested Fermi surfaces of itinerant electrons and the formation of a spin density wave order. The temperature dependence of the incommensurate spin excitations suggests a coupling between spin density wave and CDW order, likely due to flat electronic bands near the Fermi level around T_N and associated electron correlation effects.

This phenomenon is known as superconducting diode effect (SDE) and has great potential for applications in future low-temperature electronics. Here, we investigate how magnetic textures such as domain walls or skyrmions on a racetrack can be used to control the SDE in a Josephson junction and how the SDE can be used as a low-temperature read-out of the data in racetrack memory devices. First, we consider a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with strong spin-orbit-interaction (SOI) coupled to a magnetic racetrack, which forms the weak-link in a Josephson junction. In this setup, the exchange coupling between the magnetic texture and the itinerant electrons in the 2DEG breaks time-reversal symmetry and enables the SDE. When a magnetic texture, such as a domain wall or skyrmion enters the Josephson junction, the local exchange field within the junction is changed and, consequently, the strength of the SDE is altered. In particular, depending on the position and form of the magnetic texture, moving the magnetic texture can cause the SDE coefficient to change its sign, enabling a Josephson transistor effect with potentially fast switching frequencies. Further, we find that the SDE is enhanced if the junction length-scales are comparable with the length-scale of the magnetic texture. Furthermore, we show that, under certain circumstances, the symmetry breaking provided by particular magnetic textures, such as skyrmions, can lead to an SDE even in the absence of Rashba SOI in the 2DEG. Our results provide a basis for new forms of readout in low-temperature memory devices as well as demonstrating how a Josephson transistor effect can be achieved even in the absence of an external magnetic field and intrinsic Rashba SOI.

We find that an active system undergoing thermal cycling indeed shows rejuvenation and memory effects, with the strength of rejuvenation depending on the persistence time. In contrast, however, a passive Brownian system subjected to the same thermal cycle lacks the rejuvenation effect. We attribute this to the enhanced motility of active particles, which enables them to escape from their cages and restart aging at the new temperature, thus rejuvenating the material.

  "abstract": "Recently, Sukbae Lee et al.reported that material Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O (LK-99) has a series of characteristics of room temperature superconductors, including diamagnetic transition, resistance jump, nearly zero-resistance, magnetic field-dependent IV characteristics and so on (10.6111/JKCGCT.2023.33.2.061, arXiv:2307.12008, arXiv:2307.12037). However, whether LK-99 is really a room temperature superconductor is still controversial. On the one hand, some people think that the relatively weak diamagnetism of LK-99 reported by Sukbae Lee et al. is not the Meissner effect. On the other hand, there are doubts about the authenticity of its zero-resistance test results. Global replication studies have shown that LK-99 does have a large diamagnetic (arXiv:2308.01516), and also found a zero-resistance behavior at a low temperature of 110 $^\\circ$K (arXiv:2308.01192). However, up to now, there is still no direct reproducible evidence to support Sukbae Lee et al.'s conclusion that LK-99 is a room temperature superconductor. Here, a distinct resistance jump was observed at about 387 $^\\circ$K under ambient pressure in our experiment for unclear reason including possible impurity's contribution. The overall resistance of the test LK-99 sample still shows semiconductivity, and the resistance cannot really drop to zero. Our findings indicate that to identify the true potential of LK-99, high quality crystals without impurity are very important. ",

As a result of the driving, the system explores the high dimensional space of structures, ultimately converging to a structure with the desired response. However, increasing the complexity of the desired response results in ultra-slow convergence and degradation. Here, we show that by constraining the search space we are able to increase robustness, extend the maximal capacity, train responses that previously did not converge, and in some cases to accelerate convergence by many orders of magnitude. We identify the geometrical constraints that prevent the formation of spurious low-frequency modes, which are responsible for failure. We argue that these constraints are analogous to regularization used in machine learning. Our results present a unified understanding of the relations between complexity, degradation, convergence, and robustness. ",

Furthermore, the concept of recasting thermal variations as a variation in the metric is extended to thermal systems in a gravitational field. The Einstein field equations, in the 5-D space-time-temperature, is determined.

  "abstract": "Active drops refer to drops with the ability to self-migrate: these drops typically attain this ability by virtue of containing of active particles that derive energy from their environment and undergo directed motion inside the drops, thereby creating intricate stress distribution within these drops. Here we describe the evaporation dynamics of a slender active nematic drop. The stresses induced by active nematic particles present within the drop enables fascinating drop evaporation dynamics, consisting of an initial pinned stage and a late runaway stage. Unlike regular drops, during the pinned stage (for extensile drops) the drops encounter puncturing at their centers, followed by a receding motion of the newly formed inner contact line with the liquid flux pushing the (nematic) particles towards the inner and the outer contact lines: the result is the formation of a unique ring-galaxy-like particle deposition pattern. We identify three non-dimensional parameters, representing the activity, the aspect ratio, and the receding contact angle, which dictate the occurrence of puncturing, the overall evaporation time, and the possible deposit patterns for the extensile drops and the contractile drops. Finally, we argue that such unique evaporation and particle deposition dynamics can be leveraged for altering lifetime of drops for cooling and bio-applications and creating customized thin film deposits with potential 3D printing applications.

The formation of this organometallic compound is initiated by a regioselective cleaving of C-H bonds at RT. Hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations show that this regioselective C-H bond cleaving is enabled by an intermediate metal-organic complex which significantly reduces the dissociation barrier of a specific C-H bond.

Alternatively, in an explicitly Lorentz covariant formulation, the real world is a single random draw from the set of branches at asymptotically late time, which can then be restored to finite time in a particular Lorentz frame by sequentially retracing the set of branching events implied by the late time choice. The earlier version here is simplified by replacing a definition of complexity based on the physical vacuum with a definition based on the bare vacuum. As a consequence of this replacement, the physical vacuum itself is predicted to branch yielding branches with energy densities slightly larger than that of the unbranched vacuum. If the vacuum energy renormalization constant is chosen as usual to give 0 energy density to the unbranched vacuum, vacuum branches will appear to have a combination of dark energy and dark matter densities but no additional particle content.

  "abstract": "Recent theoretical predictions hint at an implementation of a superradiant laser based on narrow optical clock transitions by using a filtered thermal beam at high density. Corresponding numerical studies give encouraging results but the required very high densities are sensitive to beam collimation errors and inhomogeneous shifts. Here we present extensive numerical studies of threshold conditions and the predicted output power of such a superradiant laser involving realistic particle numbers and velocities along the cavity axis. Detailed studies target the threshold scaling as a function of temperature as well as the influence of eliminating the hottest part of the atomic distribution via velocity filtering and the benefits of additional atomic beam guiding. Using a cumulant expansion approach allows us to quantify the significance of atom-atom and atom-field correlations in such configurations. We predict necessary conditions to achieve a certain threshold photon number depending on the atomic temperature and density. In particular, we show that the temperature threshold can be significantly increased by using more atoms. Interestingly, a velocity filter removing very fast atoms has only almost negligible influence despite their phase perturbing properties. On the positive side an additional conservative optical guiding towards cavity mode antinodes leads to significantly lower threshold and higher average photon number. Interestingly we see that higher order atom-field and direct atom-atom quantum correlations play only a minor role in the laser dynamics, which is a bit surprising in the superradiant regime. ",

Be it superconducting or not, we show that the normal state of this material has peculiar quantum geometrical properties that may be related to the magnetism and the mechanism for flat band superconductivity. Based on a recently proposed spinless two-band tight-binding model for the Pb-Cu hexagonal lattice subset of the crystalline structure, which qualitatively captures the two flat bands in the band structure, we elaborate the highly anisotropic Berry curvature and quantum metric in the regions of Brillouin zone where one flat band is above and the other below the Fermi surface. In these regions, the Berry curvature has a pattern in the planar momentum that remains unchanged along the out-of-plane momentum. Moreover, the net orbital magnetization contributed from the Berry curvature is zero, signifying that the magnetism in this material should come from other sources. The quantum metric has a similar momentum dependence, and its two planar components are found to be roughly the same but the out-of-plane component vanishes, hinting that the superfluid stiffness of the flat band superconductivity, shall it occur, may be quite anisotropic.

Phonon spectra on the equilibrium structures reveal numerous unstable phonon modes. Together, these calculations suggest it is doubtful that Cu enters the structure in meaningful concentrations, despite initial attempts to model LK-99 in this way. However for the sake of completeness, we perform ab initio calculations of the topology, quantum geometry, and Wannier function localization in the Cu-dominated flat bands of four separate doped structures. In all cases, we find they are atomically localized by irreps, Wilson loops, and the Fubini-Study metric. It is unlikely that such bands can support strong superfluidity, and instead are susceptible to ferromagnetism (or out-of-plane antiferromagnetism) at low temperatures, which we find in ab initio studies.

  "abstract": "A superconductor emerges as a condensate of electron pairs, which bind despite their strong Coulomb repulsion. Eliashberg's theory elucidates the mechanisms enabling them to overcome this repulsion and predicts the transition temperature and pairing correlations. However, a comprehensive understanding of how repulsion impacts the phenomenology of the resulting superconductor remains elusive. We present a formalism that addresses this challenge by applying the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to an interaction including instantaneous repulsion and retarded attraction. We first decompose the interaction into frequency scattering channels and then integrate out the fermions. The resulting bosonic action is complex and the saddle point corresponding to Eliashberg's equations generally extends into the complex plane and away from the physical axis. Using this understanding we develop an improved numerical solver that outperforms standard techniques to solve the non-linear equations. We then turn to consider fluctuations around this complex saddle point. The matrix controlling fluctuations about the saddle point is found to be a non-Hermitian symmetric matrix, which generally suffers from exceptional points that are tuned by different parameters. These exceptional points may influence the thermodynamics of the superconductor. For example, within the quadratic approximation the upper critical field sharply peaks at a critical value of the repulsion strength related to an exceptional point appearing at $T_c$. Our work facilitates the mapping between microscopic and phenomenological theories of superconductivity, particularly in the presence of strong repulsion. It has the potential to enhance the accuracy of theoretical predictions for experiments in systems where the pairing mechanism is unknown. ",

To comprehensively explore nonstoichiometric materials, it is crucial to investigate their compositional and structural domains with precision and cost-effectiveness. However, the extensive diversity in these domains render first-principles methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), inappropriate for such endeavors. In this study, we propose a generic framework that utilizes neural network potentials (NNPs) to model nonstoichiometric materials with chemical accuracy at realistic length and time scales. We apply our framework to analyze nonstoichiometric Cr$_{(1-x)}$S materials, a compelling material category with significant potential in the field of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials applications. The efficacy of the NNP model is shown to outperform the conventional cluster expansion (CE) model, exhibiting near-DFT accuracy and robust transferability to unexplored crystal structures and compositions. Furthermore, we employ the NNP model in simulated annealing (SA) optimizations to predict the low-energy Cr$_{(1-x)}$S structures across diverse compositions. A notable structural transition is discerned at the Cr$_{0.5}$S composition, characterized by a preferential migration of half of the Cr atoms to the van der Waals (vdW) gaps. This highlights the experimentally observed non-vdW nature of CrS$_2$ and emphasizes the pivotal role of excess Cr atoms beyond the composition ratio of Cr/S = $1/2$ in stabilizing the vdW gaps. Additionally, we employ the NNP model in a large-scale vacancy diffusion Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to emphasize the impact of lateral compressive strains in catalyzing the formation of vdW gaps within 2D CrS$_2$ slabs.

Here we report a detailed study on the synthesis and electromagnetic characterization of high-quality single crystals of TaSeS. A superconducting transition is confirmed at 4.15K with coexisting charge density wave onset at 66K. The temperature dependence of RF penetration depth indicates s-wave characteristics in the weak coupling limit. A moderate electronic anisotropy is observed in upper critical fields with a value of 1.52. DFT calculations confirm the possibility of superconducting behavior of TaSeS and also suggest that the most stable structure belongs to P63mc space group. Negative values in phonon dispersion curves verify the possibility of co-existing CDW in 2H-TaSeS. Arrhenius plots show power law dependence of activation energy with respect to magnetic field. Overall all characteristics imply TaSeS to be a classic Type-II superconductor without any evidence for topological superconductivity. ",

  "abstract": "Understanding the reactivity of carbon surfaces is crucial for the development of advanced functional materials. In this study, we systematically investigate the reactivity of graphene surfaces with the Stone-Wales (SW) defect using Density Functional Theory calculations. We explore the atomic adsorption of various elements, including rows 1-3 of the Periodic Table, potassium, calcium, and selected transition metals. Our results demonstrate that the SW defect enhances binding with the studied adsorbates when compared to pristine graphene, with carbon and silicon showing the most significant differences. Additionally, we examine the effects of mechanical deformation on the lattice by constraining the system with the SW defect to the pristine graphene cell. Interestingly, these constraints lead to even stronger binding interactions. Furthermore, for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen adsorbates, we observe that mechanical deformation triggers the incorporation of adatoms into the carbon bond network, leading to the reorganization of the SW defect structure. This work establishes a foundation for future studies in the defect and strain engineering of graphene, opening avenues for developing advanced materials and catalysts with enhanced reactivity and performance.

Motivated by the recent achievements, herein we explore the stability and physical properties of novel hexagonal boron-carbon fullerene 2D heterostructures, on the basis of already synthesized B40 and C36 fullerenes. By performing extensive structural minimizations of diverse atomic configurations using the density functional theory method, for the first time, we could successfully detect thermally and dynamically stable boron-carbon fullerene 2D heterostructures. Density functional theory results confirm that the herein predicted 2D networks exhibit very identical semiconducting electronic natures with topological flat bands. Using the machine learning interatomic potentials, we also investigated the mechanical and thermal transport properties. Despite of different bonding architectures, the room temperature lattice thermal conductivity of the predicted nanoporous fullerene heterostructures was found to range between 4 to 10 W/mK. Boron-carbon fullerene heterostructures are predicted to show anisotropic but also remarkable mechanical properties, with tensile strengths and elastic modulus over 8 and 70 GPa, respectively. This study introduces the possibility of developing a novel class of 2D heterostructures based on the fullerene cages, with attractive electronic, thermal and mechanical features. ",

Results show that Al$_3$Sc and Al$_2$Sc are inherently brittle at both ground state and finite temperatures. By contrast, AlSc possesses a significantly superior ductility evaluated from all Pugh's, Pettifor's and Poisson's ductility-brittleness criteria. At ground state, AlSc meets the criteria of ductile according to Pugh's and Poisson's theories, while it is categorized as the brittle in the frame of Pettifor's picture. With the increasing temperature, the ductility of all the studied compounds exhibits a noticeable improvement. In particular, as the temperature rises, the Cauchy pressure of AlSc undergoes a transition from negative to positive. Thus, at high temperatures (T > 600 K), AlSc is unequivocally classified as the ductile from all criteria considered. In all Al$_3$Sc, Al$_2$Sc and AlSc, the Al-Al bond, originated from s-p and p-p orbital hybridizations, and the Al-Sc bond, dominated by p-d covalent hybridization, are the first and second strongest chemical bonds, respectively. To explain the difference in mechanical properties of the studied compounds, the mean bond strength (MBS) is evaluated. The weaker Al-Al bond in AlSc, leading to a smaller MBS, could be the origin for the softer elastic stiffness and superior intrinsic ductility. The longer length of the Al-Al bond in AlSc is responsible for its weaker bond strength. Furthermore, the enhanced metallicity of the Al-Al bond in AlSc would also contribute to its exceptional ductility. ",

The lower limit for the diffusivity by phonon scattering is 0.2 cm$^{2}$.s$^{-1}$. Diffusion lengths were as much as 570 nm.

We consider an elastic line driven at zero temperature in a fixed disordered landscape, with bi-periodic boundary conditions and tunable system size. This setting allows us to control the area swept by the line at each cycle in a given disorder realisation, as would the amplitude of an oscillating drive. We find that the line converges to disorder-dependent limit cycles, jointly for its geometrical \\emph{and} velocity profiles. Moreover, the way it forgets its initial condition is strongly coupled to the nature of the velocity dynamics it displays depending on system size.

The potential energy distribution and potential of mean force are analyzed to verify the spatial distribution of CO2 molecules. The heterogeneity of the pore structure resulted in heterogeneous distributions of CO2 molecules in kerogen porous media. Moreover, strong compression of the matrix reduces the number of large pores, and the PSD is mainly between 0 and 15 Angstrom. Despite the high interaction force of the kerogen matrix, the high-potential-energy region induced by the kerogen skeleton also contributes to the formation of low-energy regions that encourage the entry of CO2.

We determine the mean and variance as functions of $R$ in the vicinity of the origin, where the real and symplectic ensembles exhibit respectively an additional attraction to or repulsion from the real axis, leading to different results. In the large radius limit, all three ensembles coincide and display a universal bulk behaviour of $O(R^2)$ for the mean, and $O(R)$ for the variance. We present detailed conjectures for the bulk and edge scaling behaviours of the real Ginibre ensemble, having real and complex eigenvalues. For the symplectic ensemble we can go beyond the Gaussian case (corresponding to the Ginibre ensemble) and prove the universality of the full counting statistics both in the bulk and at the edge of the spectrum for rotationally invariant potentials, extending a recent work which considered the mean and the variance. This statistical behaviour coincides with the universality class of the complex Ginibre ensemble, which has been shown to be associated with the ground state of non-interacting fermions in a two-dimensional rotating harmonic trap. All our analytical results and conjectures are corroborated by numerical simulations. ",

However, in many circumstances involving temporal evolution, one needs limitations on the rates of such quantities, instead. Here, several general upper bounds on the rates of some f-divergences are derived, valid for any type of stochastic dynamics (both Markovian and non-Markovian), in terms of information-like and/or thermodynamic observables. As special cases, the analytical bounds on the rate of mutual information are obtained, which may provide explicit and simple alternatives to the existing numerical algorithms for its estimation. The major role in all those limitations is played by temporal Fisher information, and some of them contain entropy production, suggesting a link with stochastic thermodynamics.

However, the field of view of 4D-STEM is relatively small, which in absence of live processing is limited by the data size required for storage. Furthermore, the rectilinear scan approach currently employed in 4D-STEM places a resolution- and signal-dependent dose limit for the study of beam sensitive materials. Improving 4D-STEM data and dose efficiency, by keeping the data size manageable while limiting the amount of electron dose, is thus critical for broader applications. Here we develop a general method for reconstructing 4D-STEM data with subsampling in both real and reciprocal spaces at high fidelity. The approach is first tested on the subsampled datasets created from a full 4D-STEM dataset, and then demonstrated experimentally using random scan in real-space. The same reconstruction algorithm can also be used for compression of 4D-STEM datasets, leading to a large reduction (100 times or more) in data size, while retaining the fine features of 4D-STEM imaging, for crystalline samples.

Markers of irreversibility also provide a powerful characterisation of information processing in biological systems.

Here we propose a broadly applicable information-theoretic framework to characterise the arrow of time in multivariate time series, which yields qualitatively different types of irreversible information dynamics. This multidimensional characterisation reveals previously unreported high-order modes of irreversibility, and establishes a formal connection between recent heuristic markers of temporal irreversibility and metrics of information processing. We demonstrate the prevalence of high-order irreversibility in the hyperactive regime of a biophysical model of brain dynamics, showing that our framework is both theoretically principled and empirically useful.

In particular, the Luttinger semimetal is found to be a quantum critical point leading to a quantized jump of an integer-valued delicate topological invariant. Away from this criticality, we have identified new types of electronic insulators and semimetals with intertwined stable and delicate topologies. They all carry gapless surface states that transform anomalously under rotation symmetry. Our work provides a starting point for exploring delicate topological phenomena in quantum materials. ",

For systems with higher order Weyl nodes, which are attached to both surface and hinge Fermi arcs, additional phenomena appear on surfaces of codimension $n>1$, such as electromagnetic responses of the hinges. Here we construct a model possessing a quadrupole of higher order Weyl nodes to study the interplay between higher order topology and mixed crystalline-electromagnetic responses. We show that the higher order nature of the Weyl nodes yields a dipole of Dirac nodes on certain surfaces, leading to a mixed crystalline-electromagnetic \\emph{surface} response that binds charge to dislocations and momentum-density to magnetic fields. In addition, we show that the model possesses a bulk quadrupole moment of crystal-momentum that provides a link between the bulk and surface responses of the system. ",

  "abstract": "The Mott insulator Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ exhibits a rare insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) induced by DC current. While structural changes associated with this transition have been tracked by neutron diffraction, Raman scattering, and x-ray spectroscopy, work on elucidating the response of the electronic degrees of freedom is still in progress. Here we unveil the current-induced modifications of the electronic states of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ by employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in conjunction with four-probe transport. Two main effects emerge: a clear reduction of the Mott gap and a modification in the dispersion of the Ru-bands. The changes in dispersion occur exclusively along the $XM$ high-symmetry direction, parallel to the $b$-axis where the greatest in-plane lattice change occurs. These experimental observations are reflected in dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations simulated exclusively from the current-induced lattice constants, indicating a current driven structural transition as the primary mechanism of the IMT. Furthermore, we demonstrate this phase is distinct from the high-temperature zero-current metallic phase. Our results provide insight into the elusive nature of the current-induced IMT of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ and advance the challenging, yet powerful, technique of transport-ARPES. ",

However, Zn additions to MgGd lead to a dominant TD pole spread, while the counterpart Ca ternary alloy is less effected by Zn additions. A complementary trend in segregation was observed by atom probe tomography, showing a significant Ca segregation in binary systems. However, the Ca segregation was not effected by the addition of Zn, while added to MgGd, Zn greatly increases the Gd segregation, and significant Zn segregation can be observed. A possible reason was identified by ab initio calculations, which showed significant differences in binding energies. High binding energies between Ca and vacancies were observed, indicating that Ca, rather than Gd, preferably segregates to defect-rich regions, e.g., grain boundaries. However, in the ternary state Gd-Zn binding was found to be more favorable than Ca-Zn binding, indicating strong ternary effects in MgGdZn. ",

Here, we have conducted a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of 137 binary oxides using the presently predicted Ellingham diagrams. It is found that the active elements to form oxides easily are the f-block elements (lanthanides and actinides), elements in the groups II, III, and IV (alkaline earth, Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, and Hf), and Al and Li; while the noble elements with their oxides nonstable and easily reduced are coinage metals (Cu, Ag, and especially Au), Pt-group elements, and Hg and Se. Machine learning based sequential feature selection indicates that oxide-forming ability can be represented by electronic structures of pure elements, for example, their d- and s-valence electrons, Mendeleev numbers, and the groups, making the periodic table a useful tool to tailor oxide-forming ability. The other key elemental features to correlate oxide-forming ability are thermochemical properties such as melting points and standard entropy at 298 K of pure elements. It further shows that the present Ellingham diagrams enable qualitatively understanding and even predicting oxides formed in multicomponent materials, such as the Fe-20Cr-20Ni alloy (in wt.%) and the equimolar high entropy alloy of AlCoCrFeNi, which are in accordance with thermodynamic calculations using the CALPHAD approach and experimental observations in the literature.

We have substituted two Cd atoms in the planar monolayers by Sn atoms which increases the spin-splitting significantly. The structural, dynamic, mechanical and thermal stability of all the monolayers has been confirmed.

Nevertheless, mostly the out-of-plane electric field component is considered here due to the lightning rod effect of the elongated s-SNOM tip being orders of magnitude stronger as compared to any in-plane field component. Nonetheless, the fundamental understanding of resonantly excited near-field coupled systems clearly allows us to take profit from all vectorial components, especially also from the in-plane ones. In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally explore how linear polarization control of both near-field illumination and detection, can constructively be implemented to (non-)resonantly couple to selected sample permittivity tensor components, e.g. explicitly also to the in-plane directions. When applying the point-dipole model, we show that resonantly excited samples respond with a strong near-field signal, to all linear polarization angles. We then experimentally investigate the polarization-dependent responses for both non-resonant (Au) and phonon-resonant (3C-SiC) sample excitations at a 10.6~$\\mu$m and 10.7~$\\mu$m incident wavelength using a tabletop CO$_2$ laser. Varying the illumination polarization angle thus allows for quantitatively comparing the scattered near-field signatures for the two wavelengths. Finally, we compare our experimental data to simulation results, and thus gain the fundamental understanding of the polarization's influence on the near-field interaction. As a result, the near-field components parallel and perpendicular to the sample surface can be easily disentangled and quantified through their polarization signatures, connecting them directly to the sample's local permittivity.

We investigate the system's evolution into a strongly-driven photo-excited state with attosecond soft X-ray core-level spectroscopy. Surprisingly, we find an enhancement of the optical conductivity of nearly ten times the quantum conductivity and pinpoint it to carrier excitations in flat bands. This interaction regime is robust against carrier-carrier interaction with coherent optical phonons acting as an attractive force reminiscent of superconductivity.

Full three-dimensional calculations are presented for gold dimers in a finite-size gain medium, which allows one to easily surpass fundamental Purcell factor limits of lossy media. Within a regime of linear system response, we show how the Purcell factors are modified from the contributions from the projected local density of states as well as a non-local gain.

  "abstract": "Networks are widely used to model the interaction between individual dynamical systems. In many instances, the total number of units as well as the interaction coupling are not fixed in time, but rather constantly evolve. In terms of networks, this means that the number of nodes and edges change in time. Various properties of coupled dynamical systems essentially depend on the structure of the interaction network, such as their robustness to noise. It is therefore of interest to predict how these properties are affected when the network grows. Here, we focus on the time-evolution of the network's Kirchhoff index. We derive closed form expressions for its variation in various scenarios including both the addition of edges and nodes. For the latter case, we investigate the evolution where a single node with one and two edges connecting to existing nodes are added recursively to a network. In both cases we derive relations between the properties of the nodes to which the new one connects, and the global evolution of the network robustness. In particular, we show how different scalings of the Kirchhoff index as a function of the number of nodes are obtained. We illustrate and confirm the theory with numerical simulations of growing random networks. ",

  "abstract": "The \\emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) method is one of the most successful methods in statistical physics, quantum chemistry and related fields, but its application to quantum degenerate Fermi systems is severely hampered by an exponential computational bottleneck: the notorious fermion sign problem. Very recently, Xiong and Xiong [J. Chem. Phys. 157, 094112 (2022)] have suggested to partially circumvent the sign problem by carrying out PIMC simulations of fictitious systems which contain an interpolating continuous variable $\\xi\\in[-1,1]$ in their partition function, with the physical Fermi- and Bose-statistics corresponding to the endpoint limits $\\xi=-1$ and $\\xi=1$. It has been proposed that thermodynamic information about the fermionic limit might be obtained by path integral calculations within the bosonic sector $\\xi>0$ combined with a quadratic $\\xi$ extrapolation throughout the fermionic sector $\\xi<0$, essentially bypassing the sign problem. In this work, we show how the inclusion of the artificial parameter $\\xi$ can be interpreted as an effective penalty on the formation of permutation cycles in the PIMC simulation. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed extrapolation method breaks down for moderate to high quantum degeneracy. Instead, the method constitutes a valuable tool for the description of large Fermi-systems of weak quantum degeneracy. This is demonstrated for electrons in a 2D harmonic trap and for the archetypal uniform electron gas (UEG), where we find excellent agreement ($\\sim0.5\\%$) with exact configuration PIMC results in the high-density regime while attaining a speed-up exceeding eleven orders of magnitude.

We elucidate the topological protection of the associated (real) eigenfrequencies and illustrate the competition between the two different localisation effects present when the system is randomly perturbed: the non-Hermitian skin effect and the disorder-induced Anderson localisation.

Assuming a narrow gap between the sheets, we solve the lubrication equation coupled with slender body deformation. When the sheets are parallel, we find that the deformation initially speeds up the flow, as shown in previous studies, but only up to the middle of the channel. As the channel contracts, the hydrodynamic resistance increases and ultimately slows down the filling process. Below a threshold stiffness, the channel collapses and imbibition stops. We propose a scaling of the filling duration near this threshold. Next we show that if the sheets are initially tilted with a minimal angle, the channel avoids collapse. The liquid front pulls the diverging sheets and spreads in a nearly parallel portion, which maintains the capillary propulsion and enhances the wicking. Therefore, while it is established that diverging rigid plates imbibe liquids slower than parallel ones, we show that elasticity reverses this principle: diverging flexible sheets imbibe liquids faster than parallel ones.

  "abstract": "This paper proposes DISQ to craft a stable landscape for VQA training and tackle the noise drift challenge. DISQ adopts a \"drift detector\" with a reference circuit to identify and skip iterations that are severely affected by noise drift errors. Specifically, the circuits from the previous training iteration are re-executed as a reference circuit in the current iteration to estimate noise drift impacts. The iteration is deemed compromised by noise drift errors and thus skipped if noise drift flips the direction of the ideal optimization gradient. To enhance noise drift detection reliability, we further propose to leverage multiple reference circuits from previous iterations to provide a well founded judge of current noise drift. Nevertheless, multiple reference circuits also introduce considerable execution overhead. To mitigate extra overhead, we propose Pauli-term subsetting (prime and minor subsets) to execute only observable circuits with large coefficient magnitudes (prime subset) during drift detection. Only this minor subset is executed when the current iteration is drift-free. Evaluations across various applications and QPUs demonstrate that DISQ can mitigate a significant portion of the noise drift impact on VQAs and achieve 1.51-2.24x fidelity improvement over the traditional baseline.

A crucial step in realizing nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation is to remove the dynamical phase from the total phase. For this reason, previous schemes of nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation have to resort to the parallel transport condition, i.e., requiring the instantaneous dynamical phase to be always zero. In this paper, we put forward a strategy to design nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation, which is based on a commutation relation rather than the parallel transport condition. Instead of requiring the instantaneous dynamical phase to be always zero, the dynamical part of the total phase is separated from the geometric part and then removed by properly choosing evolution parameters. This strategy enhances the flexibility to realize nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation as the commutation relation is more relaxed than the parallel transport condition. It provides more options for realizing nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation and hence allows us to optimize realizations such as the evolution time and evolution paths. ",

To assess classical security, we explore a class of attacks based on secret extraction, including the Kahanamoku-Meyer's attack as a special case. We provide evidence of the security of the stabilizer scheme, assuming the hardness of the HSC problem. We also point out that the vulnerability observed in the original QRC scheme is primarily attributed to inappropriate parameter choices, which can be naturally rectified with proper parameter settings.

  "abstract": "Atom-like defects or color centers (CC's) in nanostructured diamond are a leading platform for optically linked quantum technologies, with recent advances including memory-enhanced quantum communication, multi-node quantum networks, and spin-mediated generation of photonic cluster states. Scaling to practically useful applications motivates architectures meeting the following criteria: C1 individual optical addressing of spin qubits; C2 frequency tuning of CC spin-dependent optical transitions; C3 coherent spin control in CC ground states; C4 active photon routing; C5 scalable manufacturability; and C6 low on-chip power dissipation for cryogenic operations. However, no architecture meeting C1-C6 has thus far been demonstrated. Here, we introduce a hybrid quantum system-on-chip (HQ-SoC) architecture that simultaneously achieves C1-C6. Key to this advance is the realization of piezoelectric strain control of diamond waveguide-coupled tin vacancy centers to meet C2 and C3, with ultra-low power dissipation necessary for C6. The DC response of our device allows emitter transition tuning by over 20 GHz, while the large frequency range (exceeding 2 GHz) enables low-power AC control. We show acoustic manipulation of integrated tin vacancy spins and estimate single-phonon coupling rates over 1 kHz in the resolved sideband regime. Combined with high-speed optical routing with negligible static hold power, this HQ-SoC platform opens the path to scalable single-qubit control with optically mediated entangling gates. ",

As the interaction parameter of the Hamiltonian is varied, it shows a transition from a gapless phase to a semimetal phase and then to another semimetal phase. These transitions show up as non-analytic behaviour of ground state energy. We find that one type of the semimetal is characterised by a single closed loop of nodal line, while the other, by two such loops both crossing the boundary of the first Brillouin zone. Surface states with non-zero winding number are found to exist in both of these phases, but over two topologically different regions.

  "abstract": "Non-malleable codes are fundamental objects at the intersection of cryptography and coding theory. These codes provide security guarantees even in settings where error correction and detection are impossible, and have found applications to several other cryptographic tasks. Roughly speaking, a non-malleable code for a family of tampering functions guarantees that no adversary can tamper (using functions from this family) the encoding of a given message into the encoding of a related distinct message. Non-malleable secret sharing schemes are a strengthening of non-malleable codes which satisfy additional privacy and reconstruction properties. We first focus on the $2$-split-state tampering model, one of the strongest and most well-studied adversarial tampering models. Here, a codeword is split into two parts which are stored in physically distant servers, and the adversary can then independently tamper with each part using arbitrary functions. This model can be naturally extended to the secret sharing setting with several parties by having the adversary independently tamper with each share. Previous works on non-malleable coding and secret sharing in the split-state tampering model only considered the encoding of \\emph{classical} messages. Furthermore, until the recent work by Aggarwal, Boddu, and Jain (arXiv 2022), adversaries with quantum capabilities and \\emph{shared entanglement} had not been considered, and it is a priori not clear whether previous schemes remain secure in this model. In this work, we introduce the notions of split-state non-malleable codes and secret sharing schemes for quantum messages secure against quantum adversaries with shared entanglement.

Conversely, information engines can only extract more work than the work consumed to power them if they have access to different sources of fluctuations, i.e., act as heat engines. We illustrate these findings first through an analogy to economics and a cyclically controlled 2D ideal gas. We then explore two analytically tractable model systems in more detail: a Brownian-gyrator heat engine which we show can be reinterpreted as a feedback-cooling information engine, and a quantum-dot information engine which can be reinterpreted as a thermoelectric heat engine.

Spin filters are spintronic components that polarize spins using external electromagnetic fields or intrinsic material properties like magnetism. Recently, topological protection from backscattering has emerged as an enticing feature through which the robustness of 2D spin filters might be enhanced. In this work, we propose and then characterize one of the first 2D topological spin filters: bilayer CrI3/1T'-WTe2. To do so, we use a combination of Density Functional Theory and maximally localized Wannier functions to demonstrate that the bilayer (BL) satisfies the principal criteria for being a topological spin filter; namely that it is gapless, exhibits charge transfer from WTe2 to CrI3 that renders the BL metallic despite the CrI3 retaining its monolayer ferromagnetism, and does not retain the topological character of monolayer 1T'-WTe2. In particular, we observe that the atomic magnetic moments on Cr from DFT are approximately 3.2 mB/Cr in the BL compared to 2.9 mB/Cr with small negative ferromagnetic (FM) moments induced on the W atoms in freestanding monolayer CrI3. Subtracting the charge and spin densities of the constituent monolayers from those of the BL further reveals spin-polarized charge transfer from WTe2 to CrI3. We find that the BL is topologically trivial by showing that its Chern number is zero. Altogether, this evidence indicates that BL 1T'-WTe2/CrI3 is gapless, magnetic, and topologically trivial, meaning that a terraced WTe2/CrI3 BL heterostructure in which only a portion of a WTe2 monolayer is topped with CrI3 is a promising candidate for a 2D topological spin filter. Our results further suggest that 1D chiral edge states may be realized by stacking strongly hybridized FM monolayers, like CrI3, atop 2D nonmagnetic Weyl semimetals like 1T'-WTe2. ",

In this paper, we tackle this challenge by developing a comprehensive framework for fermionic tensor network states. Starting from simple assumptions, we obtain possible sets of tensor equations for any given symmetry group, capturing consistent relations governing symmetry transformation rules on tensor legs. We then examine the connections between these tensor equations and topological insulators by construing edge theories and extracting quantum anomaly data from each set of tensor equations. By exhaustively exploring all possible sets of equations, we achieve a systematic classification of topological insulator phases. Imposing the solutions of a given set of equations onto local tensors, we obtain generic variational wavefunctions for corresponding topological insulator phases. Our methodology provides a crucial first step towards simulating topological insulators in strongly correlated systems. We discuss the limitations and potential generalizations of our results, paving the way for further advancements in this field. ",

In this work, we find that a generic class of critical dynamical scaling behavior can emerge at these measurement-induced transitions. Remarkably, depending on the symmetry that can be respected by the system, different integer families of dynamical scaling can emerge. The origin of these scaling families can be traced back to the presence of hierarchies of high order exceptional points in the effective non-Hermitian descriptions of the systems. Direct experimental observation of this class of dynamical scaling behavior can be readily achieved using ultracold atoms in optical lattices or through intermediate-scale quantum computing systems.

At high temperatures, where the rear earth ions behave as nearly independent local moments (LM) the system has a large paramagnetic entropy and its properties are defined by Kondo temperature, $T_K(p)$, where $p$ is the external parameter, like pressure or doping. For a given $T_K(p)$, the scaling law allows an estimate of the pressure or doping dependence of the coupling constant which is then used to find the dependence of the RKKY temperature $T_{RKKY}(p)$ and N\\'eel temperature $T_N(p)$ on the control parameter. The competition between the on-site Kondo coupling and the off-site RKKY coupling determines the mechanism by which the system removes the paramagnetic entropy at low temperatures.

Here, we report an unambiguous experimental observation of the in-plane Hall effect (IPHE) in centrosymmetric rutile RuO2 and IrO2 single-crystal films under an in-plane magnetic field. The measured Hall resistivity is found to be proportional to the component of the applied in-plane magnetic field along a particular crystal axis and to be independent of the current direction or temperature.

Owing to the exponentially growing complexity of the system, a quantitative analysis usually demands high computational cost and is restricted to small samples, especially in two or higher dimensions. Here, we introduce a variational method in the frame of fermionic Gaussian states, and obtain the ground states of one- and two-dimensional attractive Hubbard models via imaginary-time evolution. We calculate the total energy and benchmark the results in a wide range of interaction strength and filling factor with those obtained via exact two-body results, the density matrix renormalization group based on matrix product states (MPS), and projector Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method. For both 1D and 2D cases, the Gaussian variational method presents accurate results for total energy with a maximum systematic error ~4% in the intermediate interaction region. The accuracy of these results has negligible dependence on the system size. We further calculate the double occupancy and find excellent agreement with MPS and QMC, as well as the experimental results of cold quantum gases in optical lattices. The results suggest that the Gaussian pairing state is a good approximation to the ground states of attractive Hubbard model, in particular in the strong and weak coupling limits. Moreover, we generalize the method to the attractive Hubbard model with a finite spin-polarization, which can be mapped to the repulsive interaction case via particle-hole transformation, and obtain accurate results of ground state energy and double occupancy.

It is found that there exist two superconducting phase modes, both exhibiting similar behaviors of the Nambu-Goldstone mode. The existence of two phase modes suggests that in addition to the conventional free Cooper pairs as in the BCS case, there emerges a small part of the localized Cooper pairs around magnetic impurities due to the quantum correlation by the $s$-$d$ interaction, acting as Josephson islands. The emerging impurity Shiba bands inside the superconducting gap then correspond to the excitations of the ground state of the localized Cooper pairs, associated with the breaking of these Cooper pairs. In the diamagnetic response, the state of the free Cooper pairs gives rise to the conventional real contribution in the generated supercurrent, whereas the one of the localized Cooper pairs results in an imaginary contribution, leading to the superconducting Friedel oscillation, i.e., oscillation in the decay of the vector potential in the Meissner effect. As for the optical absorption of a conventional superconductor lying in the anomalous-skin-effect region, it is found that besides the conventional interband transition of Bogoliubov quasiparticles as revealed by Mattis-Bardeen theory, there also exist the interband transition between the impurity Shiba bands as well as all interband transitions between Bogoliubov quasiparticle and impurity Shiba bands.

By contrast, for the specular boundary condition, the total electric field is rotated by Hall viscosity, which means the emergence of a Hall-viscosity-induced effective -- proportional to the obstacle density -- magnetic field. Its effect on the Hall resistivity is particularly notable in that it leads to a deviation of the Hall constant from its universal value. We show that the applied magnetic field enhances hydrodynamic lubrication, giving rise to a strong negative magnetoresistance. We combine the hydrodynamic and electrostatic perspectives by discussing the distribution of charges that create the flow-induced electric field around obstacles. We provide a connection between the tensor $\\hat\\rho$ and the disorder-averaged electric dipole induced by viscosity at the obstacle. This establishes a conceptual link between the resistivity in hydrodynamics with obstacles and the notion of the Landauer dipole.

However, while CeCoIn$_5$ has 4$f$ electrons, LaCoIn$_5$ does not. By comparing these two material systems, we extracted the temperature-dependent electronic evolution of the $f$ electrons of CeCoIn$_5$. We observed that the differences caused by the $f$ electrons are more obvious in low-energy optical spectra at low temperatures. We introduced a complex optical resistivity and obtained a magnetic optical resistivity from the difference in the optical resistivity spectra of the two material systems. From the temperature-dependent average magnetic resistivity, we found that the onset temperature of the Kondo effect is much higher than the known onset temperature of Kondo scattering ($\\simeq$ 200 K) of CeCoIn$_5$. Based on momentum-dependent hybridization, the periodic Anderson model, and a maximum entropy approach, we obtained the hybridization gap distribution function of CeCoIn$_5$ and found that the resulting gap distribution function of CeCoIn$_5$ was mainly composed of two (small and large) components (or gaps). We assigned the small and large gaps to the in-plane and out-of-plane hybridization gaps, respectively. We expect that our results will provide useful information for understanding the temperature-dependent electronic evolution of $f$-electron systems near Fermi level. ",

  "abstract": "In geometrically frustrated assemblies, equilibrium self-limitation manifests in the form of a minimum in the free energy per subunit at a finite, multi-subunit size which results from the competition between the elastic costs of frustration within an assembly and the surface energy at its boundaries. Physical realizations -- from ill-fitting particle assemblies to self-twisting protein superstructures -- are capable of multiple mechanisms of escaping the cumulative costs of frustration, resulting in unlimited equilibrium assembly, including elastic modes of ``shape-flattening'' and the formation of weak, defective bonds that screen intra-assembly stresses. Here we study a model of 1D chain assembly of incommensurate ``polybricks'', and determine its equilibrium assembly as a function of temperature, concentration, degree of shape frustration, elasticity and inter-particle binding, notably focusing on how weakly cohesive, defective bonds give rise to strongly temperature-dependent assembly. Complex assembly behavior derives from the competition between multiple distinct local minima in the free energy landscape, including self-limiting chains, weakly-bound aggregates of self-limiting chains, and strongly-bound, elastically defrustrated assemblies. We show that this scenario, in general, gives rise to anomalous {\\it multiple aggregation} behavior, in which disperse subunits first exhibit a primary aggregation transition to self-limiting chains (at intermediate concentration and temperature) which are ultimately unstable to condensation into unlimited assembly of finite-chains through weak binding at a secondary aggregation transition (at low temperature and high concentration). We show that window of stable self-limitation is determined both by the elastic costs of frustration in the assembly as well as energetic and entropic features of inter-subunit binding. ",

  "abstract": "Quantum memories facilitate the storage and retrieval of quantum information for on-chip and long-distance quantum communications. Thus, they play a critical role in quantum information processing (QIP) and have diverse applications ranging from aerospace to medical imaging. It is well established that quantized vibrations (phonons) in mechanical oscillators can behave quantum mechanically and play an important role in QIP. Bulk acoustic wave (BAW) phonons are promising candidates for storing quantum information due to their long lifetimes. In this work, we investigate a hybrid magnonic system, where BAW phonons are excited in a Gadolinium Iron Garnet (GGG) thick film via coupling with quantized electron spin-waves (magnons) in a Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) thin film. Recent experiments of a YIG/GGG device show that the memories are limited by the phonon lifetime of 0.2 $\\mu$s at room temperature. The phonon lifetime is expected to be longer in the milliKelvin regime. However, the phonon lifetime could be limited by diffraction in that regime, especially for small scale devices. A complete understanding of the diffraction-limited performance of the hybrid magnonic devices is not available. We present theoretical and numerical analyses of the diffraction-limited BAW phonon lifetimes, modeshapes, and their coupling strengths to magnons in planar and confocal high-overtone bulk aoustic wave resonator (HBAR) structures. We utilize Fourier beam propagation and Hankel transform eigenvalue problem approaches and discuss the effectiveness of the two methods to predict the HBAR BAW phonons. Our analyses predicts the diffraction-limited phonon lifetime to be on the order of 100 milliseconds in confocal HBAR structures. We illustrate that a focusing dome could significantly improve the performance of hybrid magnonic HBAR structures, for quantum memory and transduction applications. ",

  "abstract": "Over the past decade, alchemical free energy methods like Hamiltonian replica exchange (HREX) and expanded ensemble (EXE) have gained popularity for the computation of solvation free energies and binding free energies. These methods connect the end states of interest via nonphysical pathways defined by states with different modified Hamiltonians. However, there exist systems where traversing all alchemical intermediate states is challenging, even if alchemical biases (e.g., in EXE) or coordinate exchanges (e.g., in HREX) are applied. This issue is exacerbated when the state space is multidimensional, which can require extensive communications between hundreds of cores that current parallelization schemes do not fully support. To address this challenge, we present the method of ensemble of expanded ensembles (EEXE), which integrates the principles of EXE and HREX. Specifically, the EEXE method periodically exchanges coordinates of EXE replicas sampling different ranges of states and allows combining weights across replicas. With the solvation free energy calculation of anthracene, we show that the EEXE method achieves accuracy akin to the EXE and HREX methods in free energy calculations, while offering higher flexibility in parameter specification. Additionally, its parallelizability opens the door to wider applications, such as estimating free energy profiles of serial mutations. Importantly, extensions to the EEXE approach can be done asynchronously, allowing looser communications between larger numbers of loosely coupled processors, such as when using cloud computing, than methods such as replica exchange. They also allow adaptive changes to the parameters of ensembles in response to data collected. All algorithms for the EEXE method are available in the Python package ensemble_md, which offers an interface for EEXE simulation management without modifying the source code in GROMACS. ",

All cluster embedded films show ferromagnetic behaviour even at room temperature. Easy-axis is found to be oriented in the layer plane in samples grown at relatively lower temperatures.

It is shown that taking into account the quantum effect of a large spatial scale in the distribution of electrons qualitatively changes the character of cumulative processes. Because of a large-scale electric field caused by quantum shell effects, the compression process is characterized by the formation of multiple shock waves. The values of gas temperature and pressure achieved during compression occur higher by two orders of magnitude as compared with the classical adiabatic regime. The analysis is carried out within the framework of the following model: the dynamics of the electron subsystem is described by equations of a quantum electron fluid, while the hydrodynamic approximation is adopted for the ionic subsystem. The large scale effect is taken into account by means of effective external field acting on electrons. The theoretical analysis carried out within this approach clarifies the nature of the cumulative process in the system under consideration; some quantitative characteristics obtained with numerical simulation are presented. The possibility of experimental observation of this cumulative mechanism is analyzed. It is suggested that the manifestation of the effect can be observed during laser compression of a system of submicron targets by measuring the neutron yield. ",

  "abstract": "Ladle refining is one of the most important aspects of high-quality steel production. Ladle argon purging which facilitates the refining process also leads to the unwarranted opening of the slag cover known as Slag Eye-opening and has a deleterious effect on the quality of steel. Slag eye-opening has been analysed in past under isothermal conditions whereas ladle refining is a transient and non-isothermal operation. The current study deals with the modelling of slag-eye opening and its effects on ladle refining under non-isothermal conditions. The bubble plume is modelled with the help of Discrete Phase modelling (DPM) coupled with a discrete random walk model for including the particle level turbulence. Temperature-dependent thermophysical properties of slag are obtained from FactSage. Opening of slag-metal interface cools the slag-eye region, which causes changes in the thermophysical properties of the slag phase. These changes are then reflected in the flow characteristics of this complex fluid. The slags flow profile and eye formation are compared and explained between cold modelling techniques and actual ladle metallurgy. The consequences of changing thermophysical prop during ladle refining manifest in their influence on the overall mass transfer coefficient and the kinetics of desulfurization. This can be achieved without the requirement to solve computationally demanding species transport equations, thereby enhancing the practical efficiency of this approach. ",

  "abstract": "Microwave remote sensing is significantly altered when passing through clouds or dense ice. This phenomenon isn't unique to microwaves; for instance, ultrasound is also disrupted when traversing through heterogeneous tissues. Understanding the average transmission in particle-filled environments is central to improve data extraction or even to create materials that can selectively block or absorb certain wave frequencies. Most methods that calculate the average transmitted field assume that it satisfies a wave equation with a complex effective wavenumber. However, recent theoretical work has predicted more than one effective wave propagating even in a material which is statistical isotropic and for scalar waves. In this work we provide the first clear evidence of these predicted multiple effective waves by using high fidelity Monte-Carlo simulations that do not make any statistical assumptions. To achieve this, we also had to fill in a missing link in the theory for particulate materials: we prove that the incident wave does not propagate within the material, which is usually taken as an assumption called the Ewald-Oseen extinction theorem. By proving this we conclude that the extinction length - the distance it takes for the incident wave to be extinct - is equal to the correlation length between the particles. ",

  "abstract": "The original motivation for this paper goes back to the mid-1990's, when James Propp was interested in natural situations when the number of domino tilings of a region increases if some of its unit squares are deleted. Guided in part by the intuition one gets from earlier work on parallels between the number of tilings of a region with holes and the 2D Coulomb energy of the corresponding system of electric charges, we consider Aztec diamond regions with unit square defects along two adjacent sides. We show that for large regions, if these defects are at fixed distances from a corner, the ratio between the number of domino tilings of the Aztec diamond with defects and the number of tilings of the entire Aztec diamond approaches a Delannoy number. When the locations of the defects are not fixed but instead approach given points on the boundary of the scaling limit $S$ (a square) of the Aztec diamonds, we prove that, provided the line segment connecting these points is outside the circle inscribed in $S$, this ratio has the same asymptotics as the Delannoy number corresponding to the locations of the defects; if the segment crosses the circle, the asymptotics is radically different. We use this to deduce (under the assumption that an arctic curve exists) that the arctic curve for domino tilings of Aztec diamonds is the circle inscribed in $S$. We also discuss counterparts of this phenomenon for lozenge tilings of hexagons. ",

Characterization of sub-wavelength patterned STE at frequencies up to 30 THz shows that the STE's emission spectrum systematically changes with emitter size. The spectral intensity exhibits significant reductions at frequencies below 4 THz, accompanied by pronounced dips at around 15 THz and 24 THz. While reducing the STE size enhances the modulation of all features, it does not alter the dip frequencies. The effect originates from the charging of the structure's edges by THz currents, causing a backflow that interferes with the primary current pulse. An analytical model quantitatively reproduces these results and agrees well with control experiments. Our findings enable a detailed investigation of the charge dynamics in STE and provide additional means for controlled shaping of STE emission spectra by nano patterning. ",

This defining feature enables M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy with remarkable resolution and convenient control and measurements in the time domain, but at the same time implies that only a tiny part of the photons delivered by accelerator-based x-ray sources with orders-of-magnitude larger pulse bandwidth are resonant with the nuclei. X-ray free-electron lasers promise a substantial enhancement of the number of nuclear-resonant photons per pulse, such that excitations beyond the low-excitation (LER) regime come within reach. This raises the question, how the onset of non-linear excitations could be experimentally verified. Here, we develop and explore a method to detect an excitation of nuclear ensembles beyond the LER for ensembles of nuclei embedded in x-ray waveguides. It relies on the comparison of the x-rays coherently and incoherently scattered off of the nuclei. As a key result, we show that the ratio of the two observables is constant within the LER, essentially independent of the details of the nuclear system and the characteristics of the exciting x-rays. Conversely, deviations from this equivalence serve as a direct indication of excitations beyond the LER. Building upon this observation, we develop a variety of experimental signatures both, for near-instantaneous impulsive and for temporally-extended non-impulsive x-ray excitation. Correlating coherently and incoherently scattered intensities further allows one to compare theoretical models of nonlinear excitations more rigorously to corresponding experiments. ",

We conjecture (and make partial progress towards proving) that when distilling from many copies of a given noisy coherent state, the coherent measurement cost scales extensively in the number of copies, at an asymptotic rate exactly equalling the input's irretrievable coherence. This cost applies to any application whereof coherence distillation is an incidental outcome (e.g. incoherent randomness extraction), but the implications are more dramatic if pure coherence is the only desired outcome: the measurement cost may often be higher than the distilled yield, in which case coherence should rather be prepared afresh than distilled from a noisy input.

We also demonstrate that these results can be obtained from a $1/c^2$ expansion of the complex Klein--Gordon Lagrangian. We illustrate our methods by performing the $1/c^2$ expansion of the Kerr metric up to $\\mathcal{O}(c^{-2})$, which leads to a special case of the Hartle--Thorne metric. The associated Schr\\\"odinger equation captures novel and potentially measurable effects. ",

In this paper we consider the performance and energy consumption of large Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) simulations run on ARCHER2, the UK's National Supercomputing Service, with QuEST toolkit. We take into account CPU clock frequency and node memory size, and use cache-blocking to rearrange the circuit, which minimises communications. We find that using 2.00GHz instead of 2.25GHz can save as much as 25% of energy at 5% increase in runtime. Higher node memory also has the potential to be more efficient, and cost the user fewer CUs, but at higher runtime penalty. Finally, we present a cache-blocking QFT circuit, which halves the required communication. All our optimisations combined result in 40% faster simulations and 35% energy savings in 44 qubit simulations on 4,096 ARCHER2 nodes. ",

At low probe power, EIT lines exhibit a positive frequency shift of about 70~MHz and a broadening of about 120~MHz, with minimal dependence on the principal quantum number of the Rydberg states. The EIT line shift arises from s-wave scattering between the Rydberg electron and the Ne atoms, which induces a positive shift near 190~MHz, and from the polarization of the Ne atoms within the Rydberg atom, which adds a negative shift near -120~MHz. The line broadening is largely due to the Ne polarization. Our experimental results are in good qualitative agreement with our theoretical model, in which the shift is linear in buffer-gas density. Our results suggest that Rydberg-EIT can serve as a direct spectroscopic probe for buffer-gas density at low pressure, and that it is suitable for non-invasive measurement of electric fields in low-pressure noble-gas discharge plasmas and in dusty plasmas.

The electric conduction is mainly along the one-dimensional (1D) Cu-O chains in the c-axis (out-of-plane). The calculated conductance along the c-axis is larger than the in-plane ones by 2 magnitude orders, indicating the 1D conduction behavior. Moreover, the 1D Cu-O chain is an anti-ferromagnetic Mott insulator at zero-doping point due to the super-exchange. Further electron/hole-doping will erase the anti-ferromagnetism. Therefore, the Cu-inserted system CuPb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O show transport and magnetic features similar to the cuprate superconductors.

For an isotropic $d$-wave SC, an enhancement in zero-bias conductance (ZBC) can be identified as a key signature of BFSs. However, for the anisotropic SC, this feature does not replicate due to the presence of the localized Andreev bound state (ABS) at the interface.

This involves calculating several distinct collinear spin configurations, predominantly by density-functional theory (DFT). The energies of these configurations are interpreted in terms of the Heisenberg model to determine coupling constants for spin pairs. However, this energy-based procedure has inherent limitations, primarily in its inability to provide information on isotropic spin interactions beyond those included in the Heisenberg model. Biquadratic exchange or multi-center terms, for example, are usually inaccessible and hence assumed to be negligible. The present work introduces a novel approach employing BS mean-field solutions, specifically Hartree-Fock wave functions, for the construction of effective spin Hamiltonians. This expanded method facilitates the extraction of a broader range of coupling parameters by considering not only the energies, but also Hamiltonian and overlap elements between different BS states. We demonstrate how comprehensive s = 1/2 Hamiltonians, including multi-center terms, can be straightforwardly constructed from a complete set of BS solutions. The approach is exemplified for small clusters within the context of the half-filled single-band Hubbard model. This allows to contrast the current strategy against exact results, thereby offering an enriched understanding of the spin-Hamiltonian construction from BS solutions. ",

  "abstract": "The Ising chain realizes the fundamental paradigm of spin fractionalization, where locally flipping a spin creates two domain walls (spinons) that can separate apart at no energy cost. In a quasi-one-dimensional system, the mean-field effects of the weak three-dimensional couplings confine the spinons into a Zeeman ladder of two-spinon bound states. Here, we experimentally tune the confinement potential between spinons in the quasi-one-dimensional Ising ferromagnet CoNb2O6 by means of an applied magnetic field with a large component along the Ising direction. Using high-resolution single crystal inelastic neutron scattering, we directly observe how the spectrum evolves from the limit of very weak confinement at low field (with many closely-spaced bound states with energies scaling as the field strength to the power 2/3) to very strong confinement at high field (where it consists of a magnon and a dispersive two-magnon bound state, with a linear field dependence). At intermediate fields, we explore how the higher-order bound states disappear from the spectrum as they move to higher energies and overlap with the two-particle continuum. By performing a global fit to the observed spectrum in zero field and high field applied along two orthogonal directions, combined with a quantitative parameterization of the interchain couplings, we propose a refined single chain and interchain Hamiltonian that quantitatively reproduces all observed dispersions and their field dependence.

Following HPT, the average grain size reduced by a factor of $\\sim$ 30, with a marked increase in high-angle grain boundaries. Dislocation density also increased by more than one order of magnitude.

Irradiation with 20 MeV Fe-ions to $\\sim$ 0.1 dpa caused a 20% reduction in dislocation density compared to the as-deformed material.

Its description requires the understanding of strong electronic correlations, which couple atomic-scale phenomena to the nanoscale. So far, research in correlated transport focused predominantly on few-channel transport, precluding the investigation of cross-scale effects. Recent theoretical advances enable the solution of models that capture the interplay between quantum correlations and confinement beyond a few channels. This problem is the focus of this study. We consider an atomic impurity embedded in a metallic nanosheet spanning two leads, showing that transport is significantly altered by tuning only the phase of a single, local hopping parameter. Furthermore -- depending on this phase -- correlations reshape the electronic flow throughout the sheet, either funneling it through the impurity or scattering it away from a much larger region. This demonstrates the potential for quantum correlations to bridge length scales in the design of nanoelectronic devices and sensors. ",

However, the growth of high quality samples is challenging and B atom clustering is often observed in (B,Ga)N alloys. To date, fundamental understanding of the impact of such clustering on electronic and optical properties of these alloys is sparse. In this work we employ density functional theory (DFT) in the framework of the meta generalized gradient approximation (modified Becke Johnson (mBJ) functional) to provide insight into this question. We use mBJ DFT calculations, benchmarked against state-of-the-art hybrid functional DFT, on (B,Ga)N alloys in the experimentally relevant B content range of up to 7.4%. Our results reveal that B atom clustering can lead to a strong reduction in the bandgap of such an alloy, in contrast to alloy configurations where B atoms are not forming clusters, thus not sharing nitrogen (N) atoms. We find that the reduction in bandgap is linked mainly to carrier localization effects in the valence band, which stem from local strain and polarization field effects. However, our study also reveals that the alloy microstructure of a B atom cluster plays an important role: B atom chains along the wurtzite c-axis impact the electronic structure far less strongly when compared to a chain formed within the c-plane. This effect is again linked to local polarization field effects and the orbital character of the involved valence states in wurtzite BN and GaN. Overall, our calculations show that controlling the alloy microstructure of (B,Ga)N alloys is of central importance when it comes to utilizing these systems in future optoelectronic devices with improved efficiencies.

This method is used to study the size- and system-dependent competition between various structural motifs of Cu, Ag, and Au nanoclusters in the size range 1 to 2 nm. Results show that there are mainly three types of structural changes in metal nanoclusters depending on whether a solid-solid transformation occurs. In the first type, global minimum is the dominant motif in the entire temperature range. In contrast, when a solid-solid transformation occurs, the global minimum transforms either completely to a different motif or partially resulting in a co-existence of multiple motifs.

While analytic models use hand-selected features that have clear physical ties to hydrogen diffusion, they often lack accuracy when making quantitative predictions. Machine learning models are capable of making accurate predictions, but their inner workings are obscured, rendering it unclear which physical features are truly important. To develop interpretable machine learning models to predict the activation energies of hydrogen diffusion in metals and random binary alloys, we create a database for physical and chemical properties of the species and use it to fit six machine learning models. Our models achieve root-mean-squared-errors between 98-119 meV on the testing data and accurately predict that elemental Ru has a large activation energy, while elemental Cr and Fe have small activation energies.By analyzing the feature importances of these fitted models, we identify relevant physical properties for predicting hydrogen diffusivity. While metrics for measuring the individual feature importances for machine learning models exist, correlations between the features lead to disagreement between models and limit the conclusions that can be drawn. Instead grouped feature importances, formed by combining the features via their correlations, agree across the six models and reveal that the two groups containing the packing factor and electronic specific heat are particularly significant for predicting hydrogen diffusion in metals and random binary alloys. This framework allows us to interpret machine learning models and enables rapid screening of new materials with the desired rates of hydrogen diffusion. ",

More recently, a number of other integro-differential operators have been proposed, including the Caputo-Fabrizio and Atangana-Baleanu forms. Moreover, the conformable derivative has been introduced. We here study the dynamics of the associated generalized Fokker-Planck equations from the perspective of the moments, the time averaged mean squared displacements, and the autocovariance functions. We also study generalized Langevin equations based on these generalized operators. The differences between the Fokker-Planck and Langevin equations with different integro-differential operators are discussed and compared with the dynamic behavior of established models of scaled Brownian motion and fractional Brownian motion. We demonstrate that the integro-differential operators with exponential and Mittag-Leffler kernels are not suitable to be introduced to Fokker-Planck and Langevin equations for the physically relevant diffusion scenarios discussed in our paper.

This fundamental effect is observed in many physical systems, ranging from electrons confined in atoms or quantum dots to ultracold atoms trapped in optical tweezers. In solid-state photonics, a long-standing goal has been to achieve fully tunable quantum confinement of optically active electron-hole pairs known as excitons. To confine excitons, existing approaches mainly rely on material modulation, which suffers from poor control over the energy and position of trapping potentials. This has severely impeded the engineering of large-scale quantum photonic systems. In this doctoral thesis, we demonstrate electrically controlled quantum confinement of neutral excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors. By combining gate-defined in-plane electric fields with inherent interactions between excitons and free charges in a lateral p-i-n junction, we achieve tunable exciton confinement lengths reaching values below 10 nm. Quantization of excitonic motion manifests in the measured optical response as a ladder of discrete voltage-dependent states below the continuum. Moreover, we observe that our confining potentials lead to a strong modification of the relative wave function of excitons. We further highlight the versatility of our approach by extending our confinement scheme to create quantum-dot-like zero-dimensional structures with a fully tunable confinement length. Our technique provides an experimental route towards achieving polariton blockade and creating scalable arrays of identical single-photon sources, which has wide-ranging implications for realizing strongly correlated photonic phases and on-chip optical quantum information processors.

Due to the spontaneous time-reversal and inversion symmetry breaking of the valley-polarized state, novel phenomena such as the Josephson diode effect have been observed without applying external fields. Importantly, when the so-called nonreciprocity efficiency (which measures the sign and strength of the Josephson effect) changes sign, the energy-phase relation of the junction is approximate $F(\\phi) \\approx \\cos(2\\phi)$ where $F$ is the free energy and $\\phi$ is the phase difference of the two superconductors.

Interestingly, by changing the junction parameters, transmon-like qubits with large anharmonicity can also be realized.

  "abstract": "In spite of intensive studies on thermoelectricity in metals, little is known about thermoelectric response in semiconductors at low temperature. An even more fascinating and unanswered question is what happens to the Seebeck coefficient when the semiconductor turns to a metal. By precisely tuning the ground state of black phosphorus with pressure from the semiconducting to semimetallic state, we track a systematic evolution of the Seebeck coefficient. Thanks to a manifest correlation between the Seebeck coefficient and resistivity, the Seebeck response in each conduction regime, i.e., intrinsic, saturation, extrinsic, and variable range hopping (VRH) regimes, is identified. In the former two regimes, the Seebeck coefficient behaves in accordance with the present theories, whereas in the later two regimes available theories do not give a satisfactory account for its response. However, by eliminating the extrinsic sample dependence in the resistivity $\\rho$ and Seebeck coefficient $S$, the Peltier conductivity $\\alpha=S/\\rho$ allows to unveil the intrinsic thermoelectric response, revealing vanishing fate for $\\alpha$ in the VRH regime. The emerged ionized impurity scattering on entry to the semimetallic state is easily surpassed by electron-electron scattering due to squeezing of screening length accompanied by an increase of carrier density with pressure. In the low temperature limit, a small number of carriers enhances a prefactor of $T$-linear Seebeck coefficient as large as what is observed in prototypical semimetals. A crucial but largely ignored role of carrier scattering in determining the magnitude and sign of the Seebeck coefficient is indicated by the observation that a sign reversal of the $T$-linear prefactor is concomitant with a change in dominant scattering mechanism for carriers.

In general, legitimate quantum operations must adhere to principles of quantum mechanics, particularly the requirements of complete positivity and trace preservation. Nonetheless, non-physical maps, especially Hermitian-preserving maps, play a crucial role in quantum information science. To date, there exists no effective method for implementing these non-physical maps with quantum devices. In this work, we introduce the Hermitian-preserving map exponentiation algorithm, which can effectively realize the action of an arbitrary Hermitian-preserving map by encoding its output into a quantum process. We analyze the performances of this algorithm, including its sample complexity and robustness, and prove its optimality in certain cases. When combined with algorithms such as the Hadamard test and quantum phase estimation, it allows for the extraction of information and generation of states from outputs of Hermitian-preserving maps, enabling various applications. Utilizing positive but not completely positive maps, this algorithm provides exponential advantages in entanglement detection and quantification compared to protocols based on single-copy operations. In addition, it facilitates the recovery of noiseless quantum states from multiple copies of noisy states by implementing the inverse map of the corresponding noise channel, offering an intriguing approach to handling quantum errors. Our findings present a pathway for systematically and efficiently implementing non-physical actions with quantum devices, thereby boosting the exploration of potential quantum advantages across a wide range of information processing tasks.

For the firms that provide computing services, low energy consumption is important both from the perspective of their own market growth and the government's regulations. In this paper, we study the energy benefits of quantum computing vis-a-vis classical computing. Deviating from the conventional notion of quantum advantage based solely on computational complexity, we redefine advantage in an energy efficiency context. Through a Cournot competition model constrained by energy usage, we demonstrate quantum computing firms can outperform classical counterparts in both profitability and energy efficiency at Nash equilibrium. Therefore quantum computing may represent a more sustainable pathway for the computing industry. Moreover, we discover that the energy benefits of quantum computing economies are contingent on large-scale computation. Based on real physical parameters, we further illustrate the scale of operation necessary for realizing this energy efficiency advantage. ",

Qutrit-based cost and mixer Hamiltonians are constructed along with appropriate quantum circuits using qutrit gates. We run noiseless simulations using PennyLane to compare the formulation against qubit-based QAOA, and analyze the solution quality and resources required. Preliminary results show that the qutrit encoding finds more accurate solutions with a comparable set of hyperparameters, uses half as many qudits, and has a notably smaller circuit depth per layer than an efficient qubit encoding. This work suggests that qutrits may be useful in solving some problems on near-term devices, however further work is required to assess their potential in a noisy environment. ",

  "abstract": "We study the generation of quantum entanglement between two giant atoms coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. Since each giant atom interacts with the waveguide at two separate coupling points, there exist three different coupling configurations in the two-atom waveguide system: the separated, braided, and nested couplings. Within the Wigner-Weisskopf framework for single coupling points, the quantum master equations governing the evolution of the two giant atoms are obtained. For each coupling configuration, the entanglement dynamics of the two giant atoms is studied, including the cases of two different atomic initial states: single- and double-excitation states. It is shown that the generated entanglement depends on the coupling configuration, phase shift, and atomic initial state. For the single-excitation initial state, there exists steady-state entanglement for these three couplings due to the appearance of the dark state. For the double-excitation initial state, an entanglement sudden birth is observed via adjusting the phase shift. In particular, the maximal entanglement for the nested coupling is about one order of magnitude larger than those of separate and braided couplings. In addition, the influence of the atomic frequency detuning on the entanglement generation is studied. This work can be utilized for the generation and control of atomic entanglement in quantum networks based on giant-atom waveguide-QED systems, which have wide potential applications in quantum information processing.

One of the key properties which are exploited is entanglement to transfer information from one network node to another. Applications like quantum teleportation rely on the entanglement between the concerned nodes. Thus, efficient entanglement distribution among network nodes is of utmost importance. Several entanglement distribution methods have been proposed in the literature which primarily rely on attributes, such as, fidelities, link layer network topologies, proactive distribution, etc. This paper studies the centralities of the network when the link layer topology of entanglements (referred to as entangled graph) is driven by usage patterns of peer-to-peer connections between remote nodes (referred to as connection graph) with different characteristics. Three different distributions (uniform, gaussian, and power law) are considered for the connection graph where the two nodes are selected from the same distribution. For the entangled graph, both reactive and proactive entanglements are employed to form a random graph. Results show that the edge centralities (measured as usage frequencies of individual edges during entanglement distribution) of the entangled graph follow power law distributions whereas the growth in entanglements with connections and node centralities (degrees of nodes) are monomolecularly distributed for most of the scenarios. These findings will help in quantum resource management, e.g., quantum technology with high reliability and lower decoherence time may be allocated to edges with high centralities. ",

This is at odds with the friend describing this interaction via collapse dynamics, if she interacts with the quantum system in a way that she would consider a measurement. These different descriptions constitute the Wigner's friend paradox. Extended Wigner's friend experiments combine the original thought experiment with non-locality setups. This allows for deriving local friendliness inequalities, similar to Bell's theorem, which can be violated for certain extended Wigner's friend scenarios. A Wigner's friend paradox and the violation of local friendliness inequalities require that no classical record exists, which reveals the result the friend observed during her measurement. Otherwise Wigner agrees with his friend's description and no local friendliness inequality can be violated. In this article, I introduce classical communication between Wigner and his friend and discuss its effects on the simple as well as extended Wigner's friend experiments. By controlling the properties of a (quasi) classical communication channel between Wigner and the friend one can regulate how much outcome information about the friend's measurement is revealed.

Turning on the coupling between the two sectors can break the degeneracy, pushing the Higgs potential in one sector into the domain of nonzero Higgs expectation (giving the visible sector), and pushing the Higgs potential in the other sector into the domain of zero Higgs expectation (giving the dark sector). The least massive baryon in the dark sector will then be a candidate self-interacting dark matter particle. ",

Here we utilize density functional theory (DFT) total energy and harmonic phonon calculations to investigate the thermodynamic and dynamic stability of two lead phosphate apatites in their pure and Cu-substituted structures. Though Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O and Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$(OH)$_2$ are found to be thermodynamically stable (i.e., on the T=0K ground state convex hull), their Cu-substituted counterparts are above the convex hull. Harmonic phonon calculations reveal dynamic instabilities in all four of these structures. Oxygen vacancy formation energies demonstrate that the addition of Cu dopant substituting for Pb increases the likelihood of the formation of oxygen vacancies on the anion site. We propose a new possible phase in this system, Pb$_8$Cu$_2$(PO$_4$)$_6$, where two monovalent Cu atoms are substituted for two Pb(1) atoms and the anion oxygen is removed. We also propose several reaction pathways for Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O and Pb$_8$Cu$_2$(PO$_4$)$_6$, and found that both of these two structures are likely to be synthesized under a 1:1 ratio of reactants Pb$_2$SO$_5$ and Cu$_3$P.

By tuning the additional adatom's magnetization, position, and coupling to the superconductor, we can couple and decouple the Majorana modes as well as control the ground state parity. The scheme is independent of microscopic details in ferromagnetic and helical magnetic chains on superconductors with and without spin-orbit coupling, which we show by studying their full microscopic models and their common low-energy description.

Interestingly, we find that, starting from a discrete model, the limit in which the motion becomes continuous in space and time ($N\\to \\infty$) is not unique and depends on what physical observables are assumed to be unchanged in the process. In particular, one may (as usually done) choose to keep the speed and diffusion coefficient fixed during this limiting process, in which case the entropy production is affected. In addition, we study also processes in which the entropy production is kept constant as $N\\to \\infty$ at the cost of modified speed or diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, we also combine this dynamics with work against an opposing force, which makes it possible to study the effect of discretization of the process on the thermodynamic efficiency of transferring power input to power output. Interestingly, we find that the efficiency is increased in the limit of $N\\to\\infty$. Finally, we investigate the same process when transitions between sites can only happen at finite time intervals and study the impact of this time discretization on the thermodynamic variables as the continuous limit is approached.

  "abstract": "Heterogeneous media diffusion is often described using position-dependent diffusion coefficients and estimated indirectly through mean squared displacement in experiments. This approach may overlook other mechanisms and their interaction with position-dependent diffusion, potentially leading to erroneous conclusions. Here, we introduce a hybrid diffusion model that merges a position-dependent diffusion coefficient with the trapping mechanism of the comb model. We derive exact solutions for position distributions and mean squared displacements, validated through simulations of Langevin equations. Our model shows that the trapping mechanism attenuates the impact of media heterogeneity. Superdiffusion occurs when the position-dependent coefficient increases superlinearly, while subdiffusion occurs for sublinear and inverse power-law relations. This nontrivial interplay between heterogeneity and state-independent mechanisms also leads to anomalous yet Brownian and non-Brownian yet Gaussian regimes. These findings emphasize the need for cautious interpretations of experiments and highlight the limitations of relying solely on mean squared displacements or position distributions for diffusion characterization.

The conditions under which the excitation can migrate from one subsystem to another were considered. It was shown that the presence of a \"donor\" molecule cannot significantly change the properties of the excitation located on the molecular chain. At the same time, the molecular chain can affect the position of the energy level of the excitation localized on the \"donor\" subsystem. Indirectly, this can influence the process of excitation migration from one subsystem to another one. The influence of basic energy parameters of the system and the environment temperature on this process are discussed. The entire system was assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with the environment.

However, the critical current density ($ J_{crit}$) is unrealistically large ($ J_{crit}$=$ 10^{14}$ A/$ m^2$) and independent on the external field ($ H_{ext}$). The stabilized magnetic state also depends on the initial state. These features conflict with the ferromagnet (FM) switching scheme as claimed in those studies, and thus call for other explanations. Alternatively, the system with the spin polarization perpendicular to the kagome plane (configuration II) is more like the FM based system since the spin polarization is orthogonal to all magnetic moments. In this work, we show SOT switching of Mn3Sn in configuration II. Similar to the FM, Jcrit and Hext are in the order of $ 10^{10}$ A/$ m^2$ and hundreds of Oersted, respectively. The switching result is also independent of the initial state. Interestingly, the unique spin structure of Mn3Sn also leads to distinct features from FM systems. We demonstrate that Jcrit increases linearly with Hext, and extrapolation gives ultralow $ J_{crit}$ for the field-free switching system. In addition, the switching polarity is opposite to the FM. We also provide the switching phase diagram as a guideline for experimental demonstration. Our work provides comprehensive understanding for the switching mechanism in both configurations.

We observe that while in case of EuX$_2$ the $p$ and $f$ states hybridize directly below the Fermi energy, the absence of $f$ and $d$ states of Gd at the Fermi energy results in $p$-like spin-polarized electronic structure of GdX$_2$, which mediates $p$-based magnetotransport.

Herein, based on first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the effect of biaxial strains on the electronic structures of 2D Rashba MoSiGeN4 (MSGN), and further explore how the interlayer interactions affect the Rashba spin splitting in such strained layered MSGNs. After applying biaxial strains, the band gap decreases monotonically with increasing tensile strains but increases when the compressive strains are applied. An indirect-direct-indirect band gap transition is induced by applying a moderate compressive strain (< 5%) in the MSGNs. Due to the symmetry breaking and moderate spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the monolayer MSGN possess an isolated Rashba spin splitting (R) near the Fermi level, which could be effectively regulated to the Lifshitz transition (L) by biaxial strain. For instance, a L-R-L transformation of Fermi surface is presented in monolayer and a more complex and changeable L-R-L-R evolution is observed in bilayer and trilayer MSGNs as the biaxial strain vary from -8% to 12%, which actually depend on the appearance, variation, and vanish of the Mexican hat band in the absence of SOC under different strains. The contribution of Mo-dz2 orbital hybridized with N-pz orbital in the highest valence band plays a dominant role on the band evolution under biaxial strains, where the R-L evolution corresponds to the decreased Mo-dz2 orbital contribution.

Here, we report the experimental observation of three distinct magnetic phases -- one ferromagnetic and two antiferromagnetic -- in exfoliated CrBr$_3$ multilayers, and reveal that the uniaxial anisotropy is significantly smaller than in CrI$_3$. These results are obtained by magnetoconductance measurements on CrBr$_3$ tunnel barriers and Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with density functional theory calculations, which enable us to identify the stackings responsible for the different interlayer magnetic couplings. The detection of all locally stable magnetic states predicted to exist in CrBr$_3$ and the excellent agreement found between theory and experiments, provide complete information on the stacking-dependent interlayer exchange energy and establish twisted bilayer CrBr$_3$ as an ideal system to deterministically create non-collinear magnetic phases.

  "abstract": "Bulk photovoltaic effect, which arises from crystal symmetry-driven charge carrier separation, is an intriguing physical phenomenon that has attracted extensive interest in photovoltaic application due to its junction-free photovoltaic and potential to surpass Shockley-Queisser limit. Whereas conventional ferroelectric materials mostly suffer from extremely low photocurrent density and weak photovoltaic response at visible light wavelengths. Emerging two-dimensional ferroelectric semiconductors with coupled visible light absorption and spontaneous polarization characteristics are a promising alternative for making functional photoferroelectrics. Herein, we report the experimental demonstration of the bulk photovoltaic effect behavior based on the 2D ferroelectric semiconductor {$\\alpha$-InSe caused by an out-of-plane polarization induced depolarization field. The {$\\alpha$-InSe device exhibits enhanced bulk photovoltaic response in the visible light spectrum owing to its narrow bandgap. It was demonstrated that the generated photovoltaic current density was nearly two orders of magnitude greater than conventional bulk ferroelectric materials. These findings highlight the potential of 2D ferroelectric semiconductor materials for bulk photovoltaic applications in a broad spectral region. ",

  "abstract": "We explore how the interplay of finite availability, carrying capacity of particles at different parts of a spatially extended system and particle diffusion between them control the steady state currents and density profiles in a one-dimensional current-carrying channel connecting the different parts of the system. To study this, we construct a minimal model consisting of two particle reservoirs of finite carrying capacities connected by a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). In addition to particle transport via TASEP between the reservoirs, the latter can also directly exchange particles, modeling particle diffusion between them that can maintain a steady current in the system. We investigate the steady state density profiles and the associated particle currents in the TASEP lane. The resulting phases and the phase diagrams are quite different from an open TASEP, and are characterised by the model parameters defining particle exchanges between the TASEP and the reservoirs, direct particle exchanges between the reservoirs, and the filling fraction of the particles that determines the total resources available. These parameters can be tuned to make the density on the TASEP lane globally uniform or piecewise continuous, and can make the two reservoirs preferentially populated or depopulated. ",

It can enhance the correlation volume of ubiquitous short-range CDW correlations and above a critical value, even induce a long-range CDW order otherwise only accessible through the suppression of superconductivity by large magnetic fields. Here we use x-ray diffraction with access to large areas of reciprocal space to study the evolution of long- and short-range CDWs with in-plane strains and as a function of doping. This further allows us to precisely monitor in-situ the structural changes induced by uniaxial pressurization of the crystals for a precise strain estimation in measurements up to $-0.85 \\%$ compression. Interestingly, we uncover direct evidence for a competition between long- and short-range CDWs and show that the long-range CDW modulation remains incommensurate at all investigated strains and temperatures, showing neither signs of discommensurations nor a pair-density wave component at $\\lambda_{\\rm{PDW}} = 2\\lambda_{\\rm{CDW}}$ below $T_c$.

The nonsymmorphic symmetries constrain the system to a four-fold degeneracy at the border of the Brillouin zone with semi-Dirac dispersion. In the case of large hybridization as for transition metal pnictides, the interplay between AM and nonsymmorphic symmetries generates an intricate network of several crossings and anticrossings that we describe in terms of semi-Dirac points and glide symmetries.

  "abstract": "Thermodynamic equilibrium is a unique state characterized by time-reversal symmetry, which enforces zero fluxes and prohibits work extraction from a single thermal bath. By virtue of being microscopically out of equilibrium, active matter challenges these defining characteristics of thermodynamic equilibrium. Although time irreversibility, fluxes, and extractable work have been observed separately in various non-equilibrium systems, a comprehensive understanding of these quantities and their interrelationship in the context of living matter remains elusive. Here, by combining experiments, simulations, and theory, we study the correlation between these three quantities in a single system consisting of swimming Escherichia coli navigating through funnel-shaped obstacles. We show that the interplay between geometric constraints and bacterial swimming breaks time-reversal symmetry, leading to the emergence of local mass fluxes. Using an harmonically trapped colloid coupled weakly to bacterial motion, we demonstrate that the amount of extractable work depends on the deviation from equilibrium as quantified by fluxes and entropy production. We propose a minimal mechanical model and a generalized mass transfer relation for bacterial rectification that quantitatively explains experimental observations. Our study provides a microscopic understanding of bacterial rectification and uncovers the intrinsic relation between time irreversibility, fluxes, and extractable work in living systems far from equilibrium.

  "abstract": "It is shown micromagnetic and atomistic spin dynamics simulations can use multiple GPUs in order to reduce computation time, but also to allow for a larger simulation size than is possible on a single GPU. Whilst interactions which depend on neighbouring spins, such as exchange interactions, may be implemented efficiently by transferring data between GPUs using halo regions, or alternatively using direct memory accesses, implementing the long-range demagnetizing interaction is the main difficulty in achieving good performance scaling, where the data transfer rate between GPUs is a significant bottleneck. A multi-GPU convolution algorithm is developed here, which relies on single-GPU FFTs executed in parallel. It is shown that even for micromagnetic simulations where the demagnetizing interaction computation time dominates, good performance scaling may be achieved, with speedup factors up to 1.8, 2.5, and 3.1, for 2, 3, and 4 GPUs respectively. The code developed here can be used for any number of GPUs in parallel, with performance scaling strongly dependent on inter-GPU data transfer rate and connection topology. This is further improved in micromagnetic simulations which include a spin transport solver, obtaining speedup factors up to 1.96, 2.8, and 3.7, for 2, 3, and 4 GPUs respectively. The best case scenario is obtained for atomistic spin dynamics simulations, where the demagnetizing interaction is implemented with spin-averaged cells. Using a single workstation with 4 GPUs, it is shown atomistic spin dynamics simulations with up to 1 billion spins, and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations with up to 2 billion spins are possible, with a near-ideal performance scaling.

The Bayesian-inference-based nested sampling (NS) algorithm allows modeling surface phase equilibria at arbitrary temperatures by directly and efficiently calculating the partition function, whose relationship with free energy is well known. In this work, we extend NS to calculate surface phase diagrams, including all relevant translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions to the free energy. We apply NS to the surfaces of the Lennard-Jones solid, recording energies through the iterative compression of surface phase space rather than a specific cooling schedule. We construct the partition function from these recorded energies to calculate ensemble averages of thermodynamic properties, such as the constant-volume heat capacity and temperature-dependent order parameters that characterize the surface structure. Key results include determining the nature of phase transitions on flat and stepped surfaces, which typically feature an enthalpy-driven condensation at higher temperatures and an entropy-driven reordering process at lower temperatures, and the presence of critical points on the phase diagrams of most of the flatter facets. Overall, we demonstrate the ability and potential of NS for surface modeling and, ultimately, materials discovery. ",

Doing so allows us to identify the athermal energy scale that excites interfacial fluctuations and the nonequilibrium surface tension that resists these excitations. In addition to establishing an active capillary-wave theory, our theory identifies that, in contrast to equilibrium fluids, this active surface tension contains contributions arising from nonconservative forces which act to suppress interfacial fluctuations. The identified contribution bares a remarkable resemblance with that envisioned by Edwards and Wilkinson in their description of the surface of athermal granular materials, suggesting that dynamically-stabilized interfaces may be a phenomenon common to a wide class of nonequilibrium systems.
